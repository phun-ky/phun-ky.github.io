8. Data is stored falsly

human factor
technical factor
natural factors

political risks
health risks
social risks
economical risks


Sources
* sources that produces false data
* sources that relay false data

transportation of false data
transportation causes false data

receiving false data
processing false data
storing false data

rinse and repeat.

coding errors, bugs, false positive

Trusted data. Can we really trust data?

Information is processed data

But what if the data if wrong? falsy? misleading? 

Can we trust an API service?

* secure?
* wrong data?
* saving error?
* hijacking?

Can we trust the media?

* Propaganda
* "acknowledged truths"
* north korea

In the old days, maps

* Borders that does not exist
* lands/countries that does not exist
* old maps with blank areas

Google maps

* THe issue where google maps reported an island, but no island was found


Can we trust the delivery boy?

* Hijacking




Can we trust a CDN?
Can we trust the backend guys?
Can we trust the author of a book?

## Can we trust the genealogist? 

* To many similar names out of families
* Few or no decent, verified sources
* Family trees are based on family trees with errors/no sources

church records/ local records

* Data that is deliberately falsly added to make sure noone knows about the child is born out of wedlock
* Family conflicts
* Fake names


scanned old books/old books
* scanning OCR identifies text wrong
* reports containing errors
* storage of books in the wrong shelf
* Storage of wrong data

pedigree

* To preserve nobility, fake claims of heirship

The validity of data is often verified by several sources, "did you guys see that? " "yes" ( who lied? )

SSL sertificates from false sources, (mention a case in the media about this): http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/12/09/serious-security-google-finds-fake-but-trusted-ssl-certificates-for-its-domains-made-in-france/


Seeing is believing.

have faith.

you cant trust data, but you can put some effort into validating data.


# What is data?

> Data as an abstract concept can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction, from which information and then knowledge are derived.

> The word data is the traditional plural form of the now-archaic datum, neuter past participle of the Latin dare, "to give", hence "something given". In discussions of problems in geometry, mathematics, engineering, and so on, the terms givens and data are used interchangeably. This usage is the origin of data as a concept in computer science or data processing: data are accepted numbers, words, images, etc.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data

# What is information?

> ... users of dictionaries need to make in order to, first, find the data sought and, secondly, understand the data so that they can generate information. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information

Information is processed data.

> the collection and manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information."[1] In this sense it can be considered a subset of information processing, "the change (processing) of information in any manner detectable by an observer." [note 1]

# What is a source?

> Definition: Any thing or place from which something comes, arises, or is obtained


technical fixes for some areas

user input: sanitazion of data, validation of data
security: chain of trust ( but we cant all be in a chain of trust )

> The assumption is that trusted data should come from carefully selected sources, be transformed in accordance with data’s intended use, and be delivered in formats and time frames that are appropriate to specific consumers of reports and other manifestations of data. 
Philip Russom, November 4, 2010 http://tdwi.org/articles/2010/11/04/experts-trusted-data.aspx

Achieving trustworthiness for data is a multi-step process:

    Select sources that are appropriate, certified, and diverse
    Process data to transform and aggregate it for the intended use, improve its quality, and enhance its meta and master data
    Collaborate cross-functionally and govern data for compliance
    Deliver data in the right time frame, in forms suited to its intended use

Accuracy of data

Data-agreement between countries (storebrand, ukraina)
safe harbour
cookies
ads from cookies

wifi hijacking of customers making payments through fake webpage ( coffeshop )

What impact does trusted data have on consumers?
businesses?
technology?
science? ( higgs boson) (proton spikes???)
