We live in a <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-time">plane in the space-time continuum</a> surrounded by data. An inconcivable amount of data. Every day we observe, process, interpret, analyze and act upon data. Not just with computers, but anywhere, everywhere.

If we take in consideration, the whole observable universe, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(data)">scientists have calculated the information capacity to be of a staggering 10<sup>90</sup></a>. How much data is that? Well, its 1.25 × 10<sup>80</sup> gigabytes. Not clear enough? It's the equivalent of all the digital data produced on earth every day<sup><a href="http://aci.info/2014/07/12/the-data-explosion-in-2014-minute-by-minute-infographic/">( 5 exabytes in 2013 )</a></sup> until <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe">the universe succumb to heath death.</a>

We are not going to indulge ourselves in Quantum Computing, the Universe or the space-time continuum in this article, We are not all quantum physicists. This article is about the data we all deal with on an every day basis, but especially, digital data and what makes it data we can trust.

To get a better grasp of the concept of "Trusted Data", we need to know what lies in the terminology used.

## What is data?

Suman Deb Roy and Wenjun Zeng defines, in their book "Social Multimedia Signales: A Signal Processing Approach to Social Network", data as:

> ... an abstract concept can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction, from which information and then knowledge are derived. 

Data is what we observe, what we perceive. It is what we humans collect through sensory input. 

>Digital data, in information theory and information systems, are discrete, discontinuous representations of information or works, as contrasted with continuous, or analog signals which behave in a continuous manner, or represent information using a continuous function.
>
> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data</a>

Digital data could be described as data that is collected and represented through a digital interface.

## What is trust?

The first part of the concept "Trusted Data" is about trust.

>In a social context, trust has several connotations. Definitions of trust typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects: One party (trustor) is willing to rely on the actions of another party (trustee); the situation is directed to the future. In addition, the trustor (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; they can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired.
>
><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_%28social_sciences%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_%28social_sciences%29</a>

The definition of trust regarding relationship between people and technology is a bit more cumbersome, since it describes a state that conflicts with the rational reflection of human beeings:

>When it comes to the relationship between people and technology, the attribution of trust is a matter of dispute. The intentional stance demonstrates that trust can be validly attributed to human relationships with complex technologies. However, rational reflection leads to the rejection of an ability to trust technological artefacts. 
>
><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_%28social_sciences%29">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_%28social_sciences%29</a>

When we assimilate, interpret and analyze data, we have to rely on a certain trust to the data we work with. The trust we rely on can be grouped in three levels of trust:

> ### Deterence-based trust (rules):
>
>Deterence-based trust means that there are rules in place that prevent one person from taking advantage of, or harming another person. In society we have laws that govern our behavior in personal and business settings. 
>
> ### Knowledge-based trust:
>
>This level of trust means that I’ve had enough experience with you and knowledge of your behavior that I have a pretty good idea of how you will react and behave in relationship with me. We’ve had enough interactions over time where there has been a consistent display of trustworthy behavior that I believe I can trust you with the everyday type issues we experience together.
>
>### Identity-based trust:
>
> This level of trust means that you know my hopes, dreams, goals, ambitions, fears, and doubts. I trust you at this level because over the course of time I have increased my level of transparency and vulnerability with you and you haven’t taken advantage of me. You’ve proven yourself to be loyal, understanding, and accepting.
>
><a href="http://www.leadergrow.com/articles/201-degrees-of-trust">http://www.leadergrow.com/articles/201-degrees-of-trust</a>

We can sum this up into: rules, experience and identity.

## Trusted data

When we now have the terminology in order, but what have others stated about this term?

> ..the condition of trusted data is easily quantified. Namely, condition is a technical measurement of data’s completeness, quality, age, schema, profile, and documentation. The assumption is that trusted data should come from carefully selected sources, be transformed in accordance with data’s intended use, and be delivered in formats and time frames that are appropriate to specific consumers of reports and other manifestations of data. 
>
><a href="http://tdwi.org/articles/2010/11/04/experts-trusted-data.aspx">The Ramifications of Trusted Data</a>

Philip Russom describes "Trusted Data" as a concept that is easily quantified by the conditions of the data. He quantifies that "Trusted Data" should:

1. Come from carefully selected sources
2. Be transformed in accordance with data's intended use
3. Be delivered in formats and time frames that are appropriate to the specific consumers

So "Trusted Data" will come from sources that you carefully select? Let us explore this:

### What is a source?

> Definition: Any thing or place from which something comes, arises, or is obtained
>
><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/source">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/source</a>

A source could be a landscape, a scent, a taste, a book, a human, an API, a show on the television.

Sources can give erroneous data, so how can we trust a source?

We can use the levels from the <a href="#deterence-based-trust-rules">previously mentioned grouping</a> to view the selection premises:

#### Rules

"The API can only give us information about this customers pension, because the rules prohibit us to view another persons pension"

#### Experience

"We have experienced enough with the API that it always deliver the correct data"

#### Identity

"We know that the API (and the provider) is trustworthy of reputation and brand"

But these trust levels could apply to sources we already have used, what do we do with new sources? How can we verify sources to use them, and in the long run, trust them?

The validity of sources is only as valid as the data given. In the science terminology, reliability is a factor. If the same data can be reproduced, the data is reliable. But what about verifying the data?

### Verification of data

The validity of data is often verified by several sources. In the social realm and the interaction between humans, i.e. communication, the validition of data is often done by confirmation: "Did you guys see that?", "Yes". 

Who lied? Did anyone lie? How can we be certain? If the verification is done by a human, and the sensory input to a human in combination with how logical the human's thought process is and the fact that humans jump to conclusions ( fills in the blanks ), there will always be uncertainty. 

Some data collected from digital sources can be verified by other data from digital or analogue sources. For example, a registered birth date on a family member in an online family tree can be verified against the state record.

But if we validate fake data against fake data, how are we going to actually have data we can trust?

...

### Examples of erroneous data

There are many, far to many, examples on erroneous data:

#### In genealogy

The longer back you resarch in genealogy, there are fewer or no decent and verified sources. Family trees can be based on other family trees that has erroneous data or no sources. Data about families can be deliberately falsified to preserve family ties, heirship and power. Family conflicts can sever a whole lineage due to the wrong religion.

When old church books are transcribed, often digitaly (by OCR scanning) or by a human, letters and text can be interpreted wrong.

#### Maps

<img src="/assets/img/4583503_700b.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail img-rounded"/>

In the 16th and 17th century, the time before Google Maps and GPS, when the Earth was not fully mapped, the cartographers that created maps for the seafarers could for example depict sea monsters on the map. This was based on myths and legends, folklore and what the people in that time did not fully understand. But later in the 17th century, the monsters vanished, relative to the scientific progress of the time.

In these modern times, we rarely find these data anomalies (or abnormalities), due to satelite mapping and greater understanding. One of these rarities was the <a href="http://www.strangerdimensions.com/2012/11/26/google-maps-anomaly-the-lost-island/">Google Maps anomaly</a>, an unknow island appeared on Google Maps. <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/11/23/travel/scientists-undiscover-south-pacific-island/index.html">This was later undiscovered</a>.


### What makes data untrustworthy?

We all process data, in our jobs, in our lives, every day. We can verify the data we collect through sources. We can trust the source itself or verify the data from other sources. But what makes data untrustworthy?

The human factors is also relevant here. We are not perfect. We err. We are all individuals with our own unique thought patterns. We perceive things differently, we fill in the blanks, interpret things. We forget. We are blind, deff, near-sighted, long-sighted, colour-blinded. We have hidden agendas, political views, personal views, religious views. All of this are factors in how humans perceive, interpret and relay data.

We have technical factors when it comes to data. Phone lines could be down, the mail could not be delievered. In IT, we could have charset errors, disk crashes, network issues, bugs et al. These factors can delete data, let data never be collected, saved or relayed.

There are may factors to consider when we deam data untrustworthy. Risks in particular.

### What risks are involved when we have untrustworthy data?

### Interpretation of data

> A programmer is going to the grocery store and his wife tells him, "Buy a gallon of milk, and if there are eggs, buy a dozen." So the programmer goes, buys everything, and drives back to his house. Upon arrival, his wife angrily asks him, "Why did you get 13 gallons of milk?" The programmer says, "There were eggs!"

To sum this up progammatically:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/phun-ky/b370ff37443c698ce285.js"></script>

The programmer interpreted the information in another way that his wife expected. You can argue exetnsively about why he interpreted it that way, but that is how we humans work. We interpret things differently.

The wife, obviously for most people, assumed that the message was interpreted the same way she did. She assumed that her husband had the same understanding of what she asked. The data was interpreted differently.

But we can interpret this example even further:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/phun-ky/655ae6c9f29ce544069b.js"></script>

See what happened here? 

>"Buy a gallon of milk, <strong>and</strong> if there are eggs, buy a dozen." 

The data was the same, the interpretation were different. This is the interpretation that the wife expected:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/phun-ky/e0022044fbb3da07d0e1.js"></script>

## How to work with data

We have now gone through the term "Trusted Data", but how do you work with the data that you want to be trustworthy?

This article tried to reflect upon the definition of trusted data, examples on how data can be falsy and how correct and false data can be interpreted in different ways. But the article does not provide any leads on how to act on this.

We begin with some key areas on how you can collect and process data. This could be used as a checklist to make data more trustworthy.

### Sources

* Have you used the given source before? 
* Have the source provided data that appeared to be correct in the past? 
* Have other parties used the source before? 
* Are the sources credible?

To recap and ellaborate on what sources could be:

* Wife telling you what to get in the store
* The TV-schedule
* API-service
* Radio show host
* Newspapers
* Web site
* Birth certificates
* The whistleblower

### Interpretation

* Have you interpreted the data correctly? 
* Have you interpreted the data wrongly before? 
* Could the data be interpreted in another way? 
* Does the consumers of the data interpret it the same way? 


### Data

* Can you verify it? (Check against other sources. Re-collect it, is the data the same?)

## A final word

>  The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them. Ernest Hemingway

In the end, you will have to have a whole lot of trust in yourself to be able to collect, analyze, interpret and relay data that can be trusted. You cannot trust data 100%, but you can put some effort into validating data. Check other reliable sources, be skeptic, question the validity of data. Re-collect information, be certain you have the correct information.

...

There are some organizations and standards that work to enhance and refine data and credibility of sources.

### The Stanford Web Credibility Research Project

<a href="http://credibility.stanford.edu/">The Stanford Web Credibility Research Project</a> (part of <a href="http://captology.stanford.edu/">the Persuasive Technology Lab</a>) at Stanford University are investigating questions such as:

* What causes people to believe (or not believe) what they find on the Web?
* What strategies do users employ in evaluating the credibility of online sources?
* What contextual and design factors influence these assessments and strategies?

### TrustRank

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrustRank">TrustRank</a> is a technique used for semi-automatic separation of useful webpages from spam.
