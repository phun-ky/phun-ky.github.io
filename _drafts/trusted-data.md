During my life so far, I've dealt with several hundres of data sources, in my professional life as a developer and in my every day life. 

2. What is trust? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_%28social_sciences%29
1. What is data?
3. Sender - Message - Reciever. ( perception, forståelse, oppfattelse, enighet, danne et bilde av, kontekts)
4. False data from sender
5. Data get falsyfied during transport
6. Data is interpreted falsy
7. The understanding/perception ( see point 3 ) of the data is wrong
8. Data is stored falsly
1. Sources are verified falsly
1. false sources
1. include something about data collection/gathering/statistics/processing/extrapolation+++

## What makes data untrustworthy?

false/incomplete/inaccurate/missing data

human factor

Humans are not perfect, we err. input error, perception error, refusal, hidden agenda, political views, personal views, religious views, obstacles in transportation ( messenger detainer/killed/delayed )

technical factor

validation, charset errors, saving errors, disk errors, transportation is slow, postponed, aborted. 

natural factors

flash fires, tsunami, power outage, electro-magnetic storm (yeah, it can happen)

library of alexandria

## What risks are involved when we have false data?

political risks
health risks
social risks
economical risks


Sources
* sources that produces false data
* sources that relay false data

transportation of false data
transportation causes false data

receiving false data
processing false data
storing false data

rinse and repeat.

shit in, shit out

coding errors, bugs, false positive

Trusted data. Can we really trust data?

Information is processed data

But what if the data if wrong? falsy? misleading? 

Can we trust an API service?

* secure?
* wrong data?
* saving error?
* hijacking?

Can we trust the media?

* Propaganda
* "acknowledged truths"
* north korea

In the old days, maps

* Borders that does not exist
* lands/countries that does not exist
* old maps with blank areas

Modern maps

* THe issue where google maps reported an island, but no island was found


Can we trust the delivery boy? / Can we trust the transportation of data?

* Hijacking




Can we trust a CDN?
Can we trust the backend guys?
Can we trust the author of a book?

## Can we trust the genealogist? 

* To many similar names out of families
* Few or no decent, verified sources
* Family trees are based on family trees with errors/no sources

church records/ local records

* Data that is deliberately falsly added to make sure noone knows about the child is born out of wedlock
* Family conflicts
* Fake names


scanned old books/old books
* scanning OCR identifies text wrong
* reports containing errors
* storage of books in the wrong shelf
* Storage of wrong data

pedigree

* To preserve nobility, fake claims of heirship

The validity of data is often verified by several sources, "did you guys see that? " "yes" ( who lied? )

but then again, the verification is done by a human, and the sensory input to a human in combination with how logical the human's though process is and the fact that humans jump to conclusions ( fills in the blanks ), perception +++ there will always be uncertainty. "seeing is believing" "i though i left the keys over there"

so, we can perhaps break down the process, and make the assimilation of data more understandable, regardless of the subject verifying/perceiving the data?

data is produced/created/saved/spoken/viewed
data is viewed
data is registered/listened to
data is perceived/assimilated ( oppfattet ) 
data is information

step 4 is vital, if two subjects perceive data differently, how can it be verified?

SSL sertificates from false sources, (mention a case in the media about this): http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/12/09/serious-security-google-finds-fake-but-trusted-ssl-certificates-for-its-domains-made-in-france/


photoshopped images in news stories
fake quotes from famous people

Seeing is believing.

have faith.

you cant trust data, but you can put some effort into validating data.


# What is data?

> Data as an abstract concept can be viewed as the lowest level of abstraction, from which information and then knowledge are derived.

> The word data is the traditional plural form of the now-archaic datum, neuter past participle of the Latin dare, "to give", hence "something given". In discussions of problems in geometry, mathematics, engineering, and so on, the terms givens and data are used interchangeably. This usage is the origin of data as a concept in computer science or data processing: data are accepted numbers, words, images, etc.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data

# What is information?

> ... users of dictionaries need to make in order to, first, find the data sought and, secondly, understand the data so that they can generate information. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information

Information is processed data.

> the collection and manipulation of items of data to produce meaningful information."[1] In this sense it can be considered a subset of information processing, "the change (processing) of information in any manner detectable by an observer." [note 1]

# What is a source?

> Definition: Any thing or place from which something comes, arises, or is obtained


technical fixes for some areas

user input: sanitazion of data, validation of data
security: chain of trust ( but we cant all be in a chain of trust )

> The assumption is that trusted data should come from carefully selected sources, be transformed in accordance with data’s intended use, and be delivered in formats and time frames that are appropriate to specific consumers of reports and other manifestations of data. 
Philip Russom, November 4, 2010 http://tdwi.org/articles/2010/11/04/experts-trusted-data.aspx

Achieving trustworthiness for data is a multi-step process:

    Select sources that are appropriate, certified, and diverse
    Process data to transform and aggregate it for the intended use, improve its quality, and enhance its meta and master data
    Collaborate cross-functionally and govern data for compliance
    Deliver data in the right time frame, in forms suited to its intended use

Accuracy of data

Data-agreement between countries (storebrand, ukraina)
safe harbour
cookies
ads from cookies

wifi hijacking of customers making payments through fake webpage ( coffeshop/man in the middle )

What impact does trusted data have on consumers?
businesses?
technology?
science? ( higgs boson) (proton spikes???)


How can we verify data? how can we make data trusted?

>  The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them. Ernest Hemingway

Data is not trusted, until you trust them.

Verification from multiple sources ( som krysspeiling i navigasjon )

Verified sources

You can never have 100% correct, verified data you can trust



why would untrusted data stand out as trusted data? how can false data be perceived as trusted data? how can false/unverified/untrusted sources be percevied as trusted sources?


## from: http://credibility.stanford.edu/

What causes people to believe (or not believe) what they find on the Web?

What strategies do users employ in evaluating the credibility of online sources?

What contextual and design factors influence these assessments and strategies?
