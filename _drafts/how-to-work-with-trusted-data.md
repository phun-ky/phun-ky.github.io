The <a href="/2015/09/09/trusted-data/">previously article on "Trusted Data"</a>, covered the definition on the term, but the article did not provide any leads yet on how to act on this. How do you work with data and ensure the data is trustworthy?
</p>

We will now cover those questions, and we begin with some key areas on how you can collect and process data. This could be used as a check list to make data more trustworthy.

## Sources

* Have you used the given source before?
* Have the source provided data that appeared to be correct in the past?
* Have other parties used the source before?
* Are the sources credible?

To recap and elaborate on what sources could be:

* Wife telling you what to get in the store
* The TV-schedule
* API-service
* Radio show host
* Newspapers
* Website
* Birth certificates
* The whistle-blower

## Interpretation

* Have you interpreted the data correctly?
* Have you interpreted the data wrongly before?
* Have you interpreted the data with the same understanding of the data as others?
* Could the data be interpreted in another way?
* Do the consumers of the data interpret it the same way?

The interpretation method will vary from each use and scenario. The perspective used to interpret those data is strongly biased with our own understanding of the data


## Data

* Can you verify it?
* Can it be reproduced?

Verify the data by checking against other sources. Re-collect it, is the data the same? Can the data be reproduced over time?

## A final word

>  The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them.

In the end, you will have to have a whole lot of trust in yourself to be able to collect, analyse, interpret and relay data that can be trusted. You cannot trust data 100%, but you can put some effort into validating data. Check other reliable sources, be skeptic, question the validity of data. Re-collect information, be certain you have the correct information.

<div class="alert alert-info">

There are some organizations and standards that work to enhance and refine data and credibility of sources.

<p><a href="http://credibility.stanford.edu/">The Stanford Web Credibility Research Project</a> (part of <a href="http://captology.stanford.edu/">the Persuasive Technology Lab</a>) at Stanford University are investigating questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>What causes people to believe (or not believe) what they find on the Web?</li>
<li>What strategies do users employ in evaluating the credibility of on-line sources?</li>
<li>What contextual and design factors influence these assessments and strategies?</li>
</ul>
