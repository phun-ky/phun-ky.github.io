Hey, you. Yes, YOU! The developer reading this article. Are you ready to call the four horsemen and start the apocalypse? Start the next nuclear holocaust? Kill patients? Bankrupt banks? Do I have your attention yet?

Yes? Good. Because all of this can happen, and will happen, if you do not keep your shit together.

How you ask? Well, how is your data? Can it be trusted? Do you think the users of your systems are safe without trusted data?

Do you really want that on your conscience?

But how could you do it better? How can your data be safe?

## Nasa

>The primary cause of this discrepancy was that one piece of ground software supplied by Lockheed Martin produced results in a United States customary unit ("American"), contrary to its Software Interface Specification (SIS), while a second system, supplied by NASA, that used those results expected them to be in metric units, in accord with the SIS. Software that calculated the total impulse produced by thruster firings calculated results in pound-seconds. The trajectory calculation used these results to correct the predicted position of the spacecraft for the effects of thruster firings. This software expected its inputs to be in newton-seconds.

Looking at server monitoring, how do we even know that it's alive? For all we know that server could report that everything is ok, even if it's not.
