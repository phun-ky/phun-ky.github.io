I'm sorry, the page you tried to reach does not exist. It has either been moved ( and in that case, shame on me for not redirecting you properly) or the URL you used was wrong.

> There are no reasons at all in theory for people to change URIs (or stop maintaining documents), but millions of reasons in practice.

If you where looking for a post, you most certainly should find it in the [archive](/archive.html). If you feel that this was an error, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/phun-ky/phun-ky.github.io/issues), and I would personally do my best to do something about it.

In the mean time, I give you my five latest posts:

<ul class="posts">
  {% for post in site.posts limit:5 %}
    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> &raquo; <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
