There was a <a href="http://phun-ky.net/2008/03/norway-says-yes-to-ooxml-despite-protests">massive protest when Standard Norge decided that Norway will say yes to OOXML</a>, despite the fact that most of the comitee-representatives were against.

The ISO-vote is currently undecided, and Norway's vote can tip the decicion in favor of accepting OOXML as an ISO-standard.

Things took another turn just a couple of minutes ago, as Steve Pepper, the chairman of the SN/K185 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 mirror committee, has sent a formal protest to ISO. He asks that Norway's vote be suspended, because it does not represent the opinion of the comitee members.
