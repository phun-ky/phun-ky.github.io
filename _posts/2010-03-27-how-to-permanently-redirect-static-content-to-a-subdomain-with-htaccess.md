layout: posttitle: "how to permanently redirect static content to a subdomain with .htaccess"description: ""category: "undefined" tags: [] --- I wanted to move all my static files to a sub domain to comply with good standards and use a Content Delivery Network. I set up a sub domain and moved all the images, style sheets and javascript files to this subdomain. To play nice with the search engines and cached pages, I needed to set up a permanently redirect (301) so the content wouldn't get lost. Put this in a .htaccess file in your top www dir: <br /><br /> <pre class="brush: bash"><br/>RewriteRule ^img/(.*)$ http://cdn.example.com/img/$1 [R=301] <br/>RewriteRule ^css/(.*)$ http://cdn.example.com/css/$1 [R=301]<br/>RewriteRule ^js/(.*)$ http://cdn.example.com/js/$1 [R=301,L]</pre>
