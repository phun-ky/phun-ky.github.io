<p>The dorment SymphonyOne project has just(?) woken up from the hibernation and released the 2008.1 distro.</p><p>SymphonyOne is a whole new type of Operating System, based on an advanced GNU/Linux base system Symphony provides Linuxâ€™s renowned stability and immunity to Windows viruses along with what we consider to be the easiest to use interface out there, our Mezzo Desktop Environment.  You can  breathe new life into old hardware as all of this is designed to work on much lower end hardware than KDE or Gnome.</p>
