A little rhyme with reason, I've just registered on twitter! You can add me with the nick <a href="http://twitter.com/phun_ky">phun_ky</a>, ( I really don't know why I can't use DASH here instead of UNDERSCORE ), <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">and I created <a href="/twitter">my own twitter page to fetch</a> the latest tweets.</span>
