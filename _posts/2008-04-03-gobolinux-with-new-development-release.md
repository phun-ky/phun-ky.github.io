To allow the system to find these files, they are logically grouped in directories such as /System/Links/Executables, which, you guessed it, contains symbolic links to all executable files inside the Programs hierarchy.</p> <p>To maintain backwards compatibility with traditional Unix/Linux apps, there are symbolic links that mimic the Unix tree, such as "/usr/bin -> /System/Links/Executables", and "/sbin -> /System/Links/Executables" (this example shows that arbitrary differentiations between files of the same category were also removed).</p> <p>Download it <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/?page=downloads">here</a>.</p> <p>Read more about it <a href="http://www.gobolinux.org/">here</a>.</p>
