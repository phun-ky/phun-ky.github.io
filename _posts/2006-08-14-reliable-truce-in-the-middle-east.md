The truce that started 0500 GMT today is not as effective as we would like. Right after the resolution was accepted by the Israeli government, the Israeli ground forces in Lebanon was trippled. Funny way of making truce..
 But as the author of <a href="http://nidstang.blogspot.com/2006/08/en-realpolitisk-fantasiverden.html">Borderlines</a> , he is mentioning a very good point:
 <blockquote>Resolution 1701 and a disarming and demilitarisng of Hezbollah don't touch the core of the conflict at all; the fate of Palestina and the palestinians.</blockquote>
And why did USA hesitate so long to do something about the conflict? The answer came from a recent discovery of a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060821fa_fact">joint american-israeli plan</a> <br/>.
