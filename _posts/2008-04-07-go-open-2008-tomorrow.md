As I mentioned in one of my earlier posts, I'm <a href="http://phun-ky.net/2008/03/attending-goopen-2008">attending Go Open 2008</a>, a conference about Open Source arranged by the National Competence Center for Open Source.

<img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/GoOpen-2008_logo.jpg" alt="goopen" class="reflect rheight22"/> I've already made my mind about which sessions I'll attend:

## Tuesday

<b>What is open source and why change?</b> - by Zak Greant, Mozilla Foundation

<b>Standardisation at IETF</b> - by Harald T. Alvestrand, Google
