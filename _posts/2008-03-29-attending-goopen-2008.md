I am attending GoOpen 2008 in Oslo, 8th to 9th of April. Zak Greant from Mozilla Foundation and Chris DiBona from Google are some of the speakers at this event.
 <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/GoOpen-2008_logo.jpg" alt="goopen" class="reflect rheight22"/>The event is arranged by National Competence Center for Open Source. The annual OpenOffice conference is combined with GoOpen this year, double the fun!
 I am really looking forward to this event, and to hear Chris DiBona speak! Will try to post something in between the sessions.
