Internet monopoly in Norway is in the horizon: The largest web daily in Norway, <a href="http://www.vg.no">VG.no</a>  published an article that literally stunned me. <a href="http://www.telenor.no">Telenor</a> , The largest ISP in Norway, are pulling themselves out of the Norwegian Internet Exchange (NIX)!
 What does this mean actually? Well, quoted from the article:
 
<blockquote>
 <span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>
    Imagine an internett where YouTube have to pay extra cash to the ISP just to show you a video. Or that you will only get a fast connection with iTunes if you got an internet connection from Telenor."
  <span class="bqend">&#8220;</span>
</blockquote>

WHAT? You heard me, the pull-out is on the 1st of July. Telenor is stating that:
 

<blockquote>
 <span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>
    The only thing we have said is that the content providers that wish a guaranteed bandwith may have to pay for special demands to the network".
 <span class="bqend">&#8220;</span>
</blockquote>
The Norwegian authorities are monitoring the situation, but the pull-out is just one more step towards a monopoly that is breaking the foundation of the Internet..
 The current model of internet networking in Norway is that all Internet traffic is going through the <a href="http://www.uio.no/nix/info-english-short.html">NIX at the University in Oslo</a> <br/>. The model guarantees that all traffic has the same priority. When Telenor is pulling out, the content providers have to pay up to use Telenor's net.
 I am watching this matter close, and will update my readers about this!
