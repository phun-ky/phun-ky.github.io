<a href="http://blog.abrenna.com">Anders Brenna</a> got to interview the ODF project editor, <a href="http://durusau.net/">Patrick Durusau</a>:
Patrick Durusau is the project editor for ODF 1.2. Considering the escalated conflict between OOXML-backers and opposers, one might think that he sided with the opposition.


He doesn't. Before the decicion, he was quoted on saying that everyone would loose if ISO didn't accept OOXML as a new standard.


Durusau spent this week in Norway, preparing for the next ISO-meeting to be held in Oslo Sunday to Tuesday, and to participate on the <a href="http://www.topicmaps.com/tmc/conference.jsp?conf=TM2008">Second International Topic Maps Conference</a>.


I got the opportunity to interview him, and I asked if he still stood by his statement that yes to OOXML is a good thing.


- Oh yeah! No standards, including ODF, stands alone. Standards are created in a social context that involves a multitude of players. If we create a situation where someone is excluded and no longer can participate, that diminishes the values of standadrds, says Patrick Durusau.


He is not happy about the conflict between OOXML backers and opposers.


- Standards don't have sides. Standards are for everybody, says Durusau.


Durusau spent his days in Norway while the OOXML conflict and debate raged. He says he's not been following the massive media attention, neither here in Norway or at the international level, despite the fact that his statement has been quoted all over.


- I don't read the press coverage. It either makes you paranoid or mad, says Durusau.


Durusau flew in from the United States on Monday, and arrived in Oslo on Tuesday. He has spent most of the time at the hotel room, preparing for the upcoming ISO-meeting.


- Standards are not the ten commandments. They are not finished products that never changes. One of the inputs that make them evolve are other standards, says Durusau.


Even though he is the Project Editor for ODF 1.2, he is not pushing "his" standard forward at the sacrifice of OOXML.


- You choose depending on your requirements, says Durusau.


He does however, point out that if you want a free Office system, then OOXML probably isn't for you. On the other half, if preservation of legacy is a consideration, then you may want to look more closely at OOXML.
