First of all, do these people that comments neglect the fact that Israel is not as innocent as it seems? Israel is a wolf in a sheep's harness, nothing more, nothing less. The accusations from the Israeli ambassador in Norway, Shomrat, are pathetic since they call for political cencorship and a public excuse.</p><p>No, I am not a jew hater, but I hate stupidity, and the comments on <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/6604">NewsBuster</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/> and the accusations from Shomrat are plain simple stupidity.</p><p>The daily Dagbladet's constituted editor, Lars Helle replies : "I think it's Shomrat that needs to apologize to us for comparing us with a Nazi newspaper."</p><br/>
