During the research for my paper, I stumbled over an article that claimed that the father of the video games was William Higinbotham. The article was published on a norwegian site for research papers, <a href="http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/mars/1077822052.02">forskning.no</a>  a view also supported by an article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Higinbotham">Wikipedia.org</a>. Quite amazing the setup he used for the game. But that's not the point, further in my research I stumbled across <a href="http://www.pong-story.com/">PONG-Story</a>, a site dedicated to "the inventor of the video game" written by David Winter.

I contaced Winter via mail and asked him for a comment on these articles, read below.

My email to David Winter:

 > Hi! Checked your site for a paper I am writing for my marketing course on my university in Norway, and would like a comment on something that I found odd. You say that it is Ralph Baer that is the father of the video games, but isn't it William Higinbotham that made the world first video game? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Higinbotham . Looking forward to a comment from you.

His reply was:

Any thoughts on this from my readers?
