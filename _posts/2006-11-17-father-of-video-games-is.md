layout: posttitle: "father of video games is?"description: ""category: "undefined" tags: [] --- <p>During the research for my paper, I stumbled over an article that claimed that the father of the video games was William Higinbotham. The article was published on a norwegian site for research papers, <a href="http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/mars/1077822052.02">forskning.no</a>  a view also supported by an article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Higinbotham">Wikipedia.org</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>. Quite amazing the setup he used for the game. But that's not the point, further in my research I stumbled across <a href="http://www.pong-story.com/">PONG-Story</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>, a site dedicated to "the inventor of the video game" written by David Winter.</p> <p>I contaced Winter via mail and asked him for a comment on these articles, read below.</p><br/><p>My email to David Winter:</p> <p><blockquote>Hi! Checked your site for a paper I am writing for my marketing course on my university in Norway, and would like a comment on something that I found odd. You say that it is Ralph Baer that is the father of the video games, but isn't it William Higinbotham that made the world first video game? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Higinbotham . Looking forward to a comment from you.<br/></blockquote></p><br/><p>His reply was:</p> <p><blockquote>Hi,<br/><br/>Wikipedia is only a web site with "definitions" more or less true,<br/>all written by people like you and me.<br/><br/>To put the record straight: you will always make the difference<br/>between digital and analog audio devices although they produce sound.<br/>Therefore, you will make the difference between one who invented an<br/>analog audio device and the other person who invented the digital<br/>equivalent sometime later.<br/><br/>This is same with the video game: one made a computer game, and<br/>another created a game which delivered video signals. Both display<br/>a game on a screen, but don't use the same technology. Consequently,<br/>Higginbotham's game did not deliver any video signal and therefore,<br/>is not a video game. It was only a precursor.<br/><br/>Crediting Higginbotham as having invented the video game is as<br/>absurd as saying that the guy who created the first record invented<br/>the compact disc although both media are of the same shape and<br/>are made to record and play back sounds. What makes the<br/>difference ? The technology.<br/><br/>Same with the video game VS computer games.<br/><br/><br/></blockquote></p> <p>Any thoughts on this from my readers?</p>
