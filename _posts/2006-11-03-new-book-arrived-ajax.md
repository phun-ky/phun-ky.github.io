So it has begun. I've been trying to get hold of some good tutorials for AJAX, but I've never found them to be good enough. After browsing a bit through SitePoint, I found a AJAX book: "Build your own AJAX Web Application". The title sounds promising, but how would I know before I've started to read it? I got a free CSS spread sheet with it, so it will help my CSS repository a bit (my head that is :P )

To check out the  book, you can download a free chapter to see if it has any interest for you, visit <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/ajax1/">SitePoint</a>.

The reason why I suddenly dive into AJAX is just because it is hip in the web development nowadays. When I say hip, I mean that it is the customers that want fancy sites and the developers can't say shit :/ . It will be fun though. Stay tuned for my first AJAX Web App.
