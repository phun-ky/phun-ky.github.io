I was twisting my head trying to figure the best way to fetch data from the squid log server for a new internal statistic project at work, when I decided to make a parser myself rather than trying to find a pre-made parser and adjust it to fit my needs. After over 4 different prototypes getting a no-go from our DBA - the script had to insert rows in intervals - I finally made myself and the DBA happy.
 The script is free to use, but please keep the copyright.
