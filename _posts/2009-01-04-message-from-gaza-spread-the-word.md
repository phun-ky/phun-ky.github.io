But the two brave Norwegian doctors in Shifa tries.. Spread the word!<br /><br/><br /><br/><blockquote>They bombed the central market in Gaza for two hours ago. 80 people got hurt, 20 killed, everything came here to Shifa. Hades! We're wading in bodies. Blood and amputees. Lots of children. Pregnant woman. I have never experienced something this dreadful. We hear tanks now. Spread the word, shout it. Everything. DO SOMETHING! DO MORE! We are in the history books now, everyone!<br /><br/><br /><br/>Mads G, 3.1.09 13:50, Gaza Palestine</blockquote><br /><br/><br /><br/>The photo is copyrighted: MAHMUD HAMS / AFP / SCANPIX
