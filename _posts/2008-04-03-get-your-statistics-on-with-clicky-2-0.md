Clicky is a web analyzer that works great with any web site, even Ajax and Flash sites. It was originally targeted towards smaller web sites and blogs because it tracks a high level of detail on every visitor, and these types of sites find this information very interesting.</p><img src="/images/dashboard_small.gif" alt="" class="reflect rheight10" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"/><br/><p>Where can get it?
