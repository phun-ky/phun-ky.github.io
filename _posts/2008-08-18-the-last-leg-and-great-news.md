<p>Well, we came back home a week ago, after spending 3 days at Hamarøya.</p> <p>The drive home from Hamarøya took about 16.5 hours alltogether if we don't count the breaks we had in. Was great to come home and see our cats again!</p>

<p>The great news, is that on the ferrry between Lødingen and Bognes, I proposed to my girlfriend, and she said yes! So now we're getting married!</p>
