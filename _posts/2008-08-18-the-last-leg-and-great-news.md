Well, we came back home a week ago, after spending 3 days at Hamarøya.
 The drive home from Hamarøya took about 16.5 hours alltogether if we don't count the breaks we had in. Was great to come home and see our cats again!


The great news, is that on the ferrry between Lødingen and Bognes, I proposed to my girlfriend, and she said yes! So now we're getting married!
