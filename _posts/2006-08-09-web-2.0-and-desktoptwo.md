layout: posttitle: "web 2.0 and desktoptwo"description: ""category: "undefined" tags: [] --- <p>In these days, we hear about the phenomena "web 2.0" more and more often. To make it short, web 2.0 is a phrase made to describe second generation network generic services on the Internet. It is not like some might think it is, a second version of the Internet. And the subject for this post is, you've guessed it, a web 2.0 service.</p> <p>Searched the forums of <a href="http://www.diskusjon.no">Diskusjon.no</a> , the forum for the largest norwegian hardware community, <a href="http://www.hardware.no">Hardware.no</a> , and stumbled over a link to something called <a href="http://desktoptwo.com/">Desktoptwo</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>. I clicked the link mentioned and there I was. <a href="http://desktoptwo.com/">Desktoptwo</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/> offers a online desktop with over 1GB of disk space. It includes everything a normal desktop has, background image, icons, IM services, desktop look-a-like mail interface and much more. I am not advertising about it, but if you are interested in new web services, try it ;)</p>
