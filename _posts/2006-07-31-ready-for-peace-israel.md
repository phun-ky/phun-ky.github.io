<p>The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5229058.stm">UN Council 'shocked' by Qana raid</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/gb.png" alt="gb flag"/>. Over 54 civilian lives were lost in the Qana raid, most of them children. France has already circulated a draft resolution to call for an immediate end of the hostilities. Kofi Annan clearly states:</p><p><blockquote>"Action is needed now before many more children, women and men become casualties of a conflict over which they have no control."</blockquote></p><p></p><p>Even though the world urges all sides of the conflict to immediate cease fire, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5230192.stm">Israel is 'not ready for truce yet'</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/gb.png" alt="gb flag"/>. How can the main aggressor claim to be not ready for peace? I find it horrible.</p><p><blockquote>Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz has said that, despite a 48-hour halt to air strikes on south Lebanon, Israel cannot agree to an immediate ceasefire."</blockquote></p><p>And still, after announcement from the Israelis to suspend the airstrikes, Israeli war planes still carry out bombing raids in southern Lebanon.</p><p><blockquote>"Israel says it reserves the right to take action against targets if it believes its troops or civilians are under threat."</blockquote></p><p>But what about the Lebanese civilians?</p><p>The USA believes in lasting peace after the "announcement of cease fire" from the Israelis. Condoleezza Rice, you have to work harder!</p><p>For more information for my Norwegian readers the article <a href="http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2006/07/31/472635.html">Israel med nye angrep p√• Libanon</a>  covers this post. And the latest entry at a very good blog, Borderlines, <a href="http://nidstang.blogspot.com/2006/07/markering-mot-israels-massakre-i-qana.html">the Lebanese Union in Norway rallies to protests</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/no.png" alt="no flag"/>.</p> <p>(Foto used in my post is licensed to Scanpix.</p>
