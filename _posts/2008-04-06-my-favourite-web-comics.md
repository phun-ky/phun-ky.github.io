Just a little post here, I thought I'd share with you what my favourite web comics are:
 <a href="http://www.darklegacycomics.com/">Dark Legacy Comic</a> by Arad Kedar.

<a href="http://www.lfgcomic.com/">Looking For Group</a> by Blind Ferret Entertainment.

<a href="http://www.thenoobcomic.com/">The Noob Comic</a> by Gianna Masetti.

<a href="http://gucomics.com/">GU Comics</a> by Woody Hearn.

<a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/">Userfriendly</a> by J.D. Frazer.

Yeah, they are pretty gamer oriented, but hey, I am a gamer ;)
