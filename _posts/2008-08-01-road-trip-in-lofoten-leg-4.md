<p>Well, we've started the very very short 4th leg now, it's about 40 minute drive from our last stop, Reine. We're heading to Fredvang, because there's a music festival there that we're going to attend, Alofestivalen!.</p> <p>After the festival, we're heading to Nesje. Stay tuned for pictures.</p>
