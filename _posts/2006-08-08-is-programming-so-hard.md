<p>Not now! Just stumbled over a fantastic site with over 600 code snippets for many languages, PHP, ruby, C#, python and so on. They also got bash scripting snippets, SQL and CSS. If you can't program after this, you may have to rethink your skills.</p> <p>Check out <a href="http://programmingishard.com/">programmingishard.com</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>.</p> <p>A little update, at the moment, the server is down :/ so please be patient! </p>
