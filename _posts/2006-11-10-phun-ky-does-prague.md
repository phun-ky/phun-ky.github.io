Yes, you read it right, I am in Prague doing seminars with one of my jobs. After all the hard work, we stumbled out of the conference room and made our way out in the city. Quite nice culture and scenery troughout the city ^^.
 If you are a close friend of mine, you would've known that today, the 10th of november, is my birthday! Thanks for all the IM's, mails and SMS's recieved!
 Some pretty nice things has happened, but I hope that you have noticed yourself :P . PlayStation 3 has launched in Japan, (11th of november there now;) ) the U.S. has approved of a Russian membership in WTO and the U.S. Senate is won by the democrats! Go elephants!
