*Errhh.. "The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.." I was off by 2 years according to Wikipedia. *

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_wide_web">World Wide Web</a> is celebrating its 15th birthday this year so I made this little post just to say: Congratulations!
 A little anecdote from Douglas Adams:
 
 > "The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for."
