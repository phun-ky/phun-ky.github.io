I read the article on Wikipedia about this and learned some new things.</p> <p>A little excerpt from the article:</p> <br/><br/><p>The origins of this custom are complex and a matter of much debate. It is likely a relic of the once common festivities held on the vernal equinox, which began on the 25th of March, old New Year's Day, and ended on the 2nd of April.</p><br/><br/><p>Though the 1st of April appears to have been observed as a general festival in Great Britain in antiquity, it was apparently not until the beginning of the 18th century that the making of April-fools was a common custom. In Scotland the custom was known as "hunting the gowk," i.e. the cuckoo, and April-fools were "April-gowks," the cuckoo being a term of contempt, as it is in many countries.</p><br/><br/><p>One of the earliest connections of the day with fools is Chaucer's story the Nun's Priest's Tale (c.1400), which concerns two fools and takes place "thritty dayes and two" from the beginning of March, which is April 1. The significance of this is difficult to determine.</p><br/><br/><p>Mark Twain described this day best: <i>"April 1st: This is the day upon which we are reminded of what we are on the other three-hundred and sixty-four."</i></p><br/><br/><p>Have you been fooled today? If so, please leave a comment about it! </p>
