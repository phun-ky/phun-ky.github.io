<p>Remember to set your clock FORWARD (no, not backward) one hour before you go to bed tonight. Yes, it means one hour less sleep, but it also means one hour more sunlight the entire summer!</p> <p>A little excerpt from the Wikipedia article about this: </p> <p><blockquote>Daylight saving time (DST; also summer time in British English) is the convention of advancing clocks so that afternoons have more daylight and mornings have less. Typically clocks are adjusted forward one hour near the start of spring and are adjusted backward in autumn.</blockquote></p>
