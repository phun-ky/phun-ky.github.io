This book is written by <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a>. <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a> created YSlow, the Firefox add-on that analyzes web page performance according to the 14 rules described in this book. It works with <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>.
 The book describes 14 best practices for faster web pages. It's had great reviews on <a href="http://stevesouders.com/hpws/amazon-rank.php">Amazon</a> (#1 in Computers), <a href="http://stevesouders.com/hpws/slashdot.php">Slashdot</a>, and <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/high_performance_websites.html">O'Reilly Radar</a>.
 Mainly I bought this book after I've used the YSlow plugin for a while, I got more interested in the subject and the YSlow pages didn't quite cover it. Looking forward to use it extensively in my web development projects.
