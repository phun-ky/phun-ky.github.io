Adobe announced last night that they've released an early alpha version of their Air software for the GNU/Linux plattform. Air is a solution that combines several of the existing web technologies out there, HTML, AJAX, Flash and Flex to build richer web applications that can run directly on any computer.

 The release also includes the SDK and a newer release of FLexBuilder for Linux.

Adobe also announced that they've registered as members in the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.linux-foundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a> <br/>
