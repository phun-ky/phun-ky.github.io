<p>Great news from Gentoo Linux! They've released their latest beta, 2008.0 beta 1.</p><p>Gentoo Linux is a versatile and fast, completely free Linux
distribution geared towards developers and network professionals.
Unlike other distros, Gentoo Linux has an advanced package management
system called Portage. Portage is a true ports system in the tradition
of BSD ports, but is Python-based and sports a number of advanced
features including dependencies, fine-grained package management,
"fake" (OpenBSD-style) installs, safe unmerging, system profiles,
virtual packages, config file management, and much much more.</p> <p>To download the serveral release versions , go <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/mirrors.xml">here</a>.</p> <p>Read more about it <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">here</a>.</p>
