Great news from Gentoo Linux! They've released their latest beta, 2008.0 beta 1.

Gentoo Linux is a versatile and fast, completely free Linux
distribution geared towards developers and network professionals.
Unlike other distros, Gentoo Linux has an advanced package management
system called Portage. Portage is a true ports system in the tradition
of BSD ports, but is Python-based and sports a number of advanced
features including dependencies, fine-grained package management,
"fake" (OpenBSD-style) installs, safe unmerging, system profiles,
virtual packages, config file management, and much much more.
