To get there, we're road tripping.</p> <p>I'm going to upload some pictures and keep my few readers updated on our trip.</p> <p>Why road trip? Well, we're having summer vacation here, and we've decided to visit relatives (especially on my behalf because I don't see them much) and to enjoy the beautiful scenery we wouldn't see if we were flying with an airplane. </p> <p>During this trip I will test out the ICE D50 USB modem (mobile broadband from ice.net) to the fullest of its potential, with Ubuntu of course.</p> <h3>The first leg!</h3><p>The first leg is from our residence in BÃ¦rum and via my parents (not plotted in), straight north until we're spending the night at a motel in Namskogan.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p>
