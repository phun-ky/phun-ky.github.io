Very short post here, but I got hold of a very useful tutorial that helped me pretty much when I tried to install Pidgin.
 The Romanian blogger Marilen Corciovei writes a little howto on it: <a href="http://www.len.ro/work/tools/ubuntu-feisty-fawn-on-a-dell-latitude-d820/install-pidgin">len.ro</a> <br/>
 A quick "what is Pidgin": "Pidgin is a multi-protocol Instant Messaging client that allows you to use all of your IM accounts at once."
