<p>As i mentioned in my article "<a href="http://phun-ky.net/2007/06/internet-monopoly-in-norway">Internet monopoly in Norway</a>", the largest ISP in Norway, Telenor, withdrew from the Norwegian Internet Exchange (NIX). This has happened since:</p> <p>The Norwegian Post and Telecommuncations Authority called in the chiefs of Telenor and the report that followed concluded that the whole operation was approved, strangely enough.</p> <p>The aftermath of this is not clear yet, but several politicians has stated that they want to investigate Telenor further and some even went so far to say that Telenor have to give up all of their profit basis, the wired telecommunications net (the net was build by the state, and when Telenor underwent privatization, they got the old net for free).</p> <p>The whole situation is followed with great attention, so we'll see how the aftermath plays out.</p>
