Well, I took a sneak at the daily comic strip of M, authored and drawn by Mads Eriksen, and I didn't quite get it, so I googled and came across a YouTub clip containing the explanation in form of a old Muppet Show sequence.
 Have a look at the comic,then check out the clip:

 The norwegian in the last frame is translated into: "...of ALL the lousy tri..", got it? 
The link to the comic strip is <a href="http://www.start.no/tegneserier/m/?1169852400">here</a> , and the clip is here:
