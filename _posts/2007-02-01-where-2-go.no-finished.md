My latest project at work is now finished and scheduled for release today. I am pretty pleased with the outcome of this. The page is a teaser for the new magazine WHERE2GO released in Oslo (Norway) today. It is a freely distributed magazine for fashion, trends, festivals, concerts and other happenings in Oslo.

The concept is from our sister corporation in Denmark, and it is published in Copenhagen and Ã…rhus. To check out the danish site, <a href="http://www.where2go.dk">click here</a>.
