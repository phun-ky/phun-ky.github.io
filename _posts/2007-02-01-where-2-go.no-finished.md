The page is a teaser for the new magazine WHERE2GO released in Oslo (Norway) today. It is a freely distributed magazine for fashion, trends, festivals, concerts and other happenings in Oslo.</p> <p>The concept is from our sister corporation in Denmark, and it is published in Copenhagen and &Aring;rhus.
