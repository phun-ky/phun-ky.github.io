I stumbled upon a very interesting new linux distro when I checked <a href="http://www.distrowatch.com">DistroWatch</a> this morning, a new distro called gOS (Good OS), with integration of <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> products and <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a> apps.


gOS is an easy-to-use, <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>-based distribution designed for less technical computer users. Its main features are the use of <span class="strike"><a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/" >Enlightenment</a></span> Gnome as the default desktop and tight integration of various Google products and services into the product.


Download it <a href="http://dev.thinkgos.com/downloads">here</a>.
