Some great news from desktoplinux.com! They recently revealed the desktop survey results. The facts are there, the number of desktop linux users has doubled the last year!

And what is the desktop linux users distribution of choice? The Ubuntu family (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, Edubuntu) leads on, and SuSe is the second runner up.

To read all the survey results, <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8454912761.html">go to desktoplinux.com</a>.

The survey shows us that more and more people are trying out a GNU/Linux distro, more and more people are getting aware that they can choose their OS. Up until Dell started to cooperate with Ubuntu, we had to accept that a PC you ordered came with a MS OS install (unless you bought parts and built your own pc).
