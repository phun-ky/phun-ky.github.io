<p>Some great news from desktoplinux.com! They recently revealed the desktop survey results. The facts are there, the number of desktop linux users has doubled the last year!</p> <p>And what is the desktop linux users distribution of choice? The Ubuntu family (Xubuntu, Kubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio, Edubuntu) leads on, and SuSe is the second runner up.</p> <p>To read all the survey results, <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8454912761.html">go to desktoplinux.com</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>.</p> <p>The survey shows us that more and more people are trying out a GNU/Linux distro, more and more people are getting aware that they can choose their OS. Up until Dell started to cooperate with Ubuntu, we had to accept that a PC you ordered came with a MS OS install (unless you bought parts and built your own pc). </p>
