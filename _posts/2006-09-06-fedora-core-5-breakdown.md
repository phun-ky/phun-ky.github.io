<p>If you have been dealing with Linux over the last three or four years, you should have stumbled across a distro called Fedora. This article is meant to elaborate the whole concept of Fedora and to give new users a helping hand.</p> <p>First of all, what is Fedora? Fedora is really a Russian female name, but it is also the name of the type of hat you see in the Red Hat Linux logo. The link to Red Hat starts there.</p> <p>Fedora, or Fedora Core, is a project developed and maintained by the community-supported Fedora Project and it's sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora aims to be a complete, general-purpose operating system built from open source software. Ok, enough with Wikipedia, but let us mention the only things needed to know;</p> <ul><li>It's a community-supported project. That means that you  can be involved in creating Fedora Core, if you want.</li><li>A new version of Fedora Core comes out every six months.</li><li>When a new version comes out, the previous version becomes unsupported after another 6 - 8 months.</li><li>And as a little perk, it is completely free.</li></ul> <p>If you want to read more about Fedora, use these links: <a href="http://www.fedorafaq.org">The Unofficial Fedora Faq</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>, <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com">Fedora Project</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Core">Fedora Wiki</a> <img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/flag/us.png" alt="us flag"/>.</p> <p>More to come!</p>
