After a sleepless, hot and back-injuring night at the motel in Namsskogan, we startet our second part of the road trip, from Namsskogan to Hamar√∏y.
 In this leg, we're driving over Saltfjellet and we're crossing the Polar Circle.

### Marthe forgot her cellphone!
 After driving in about 1 hour from the motel, right before we were supposed to cross the municipal border, Marthe coulnd't find her cellphone, so we called the motel, and wouldn't you know it, we had to turn around to get it and loose 1 hour of our schedule.
 Oh well, we're back on track very soon.
