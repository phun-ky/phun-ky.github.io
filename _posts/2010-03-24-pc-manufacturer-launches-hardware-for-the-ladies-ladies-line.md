Stumbled upon this PC ad when I browsed [PS.no](http://ps.no) for some components, and I think it's worth mentioning. It is a PC specifically made and targeted to one demographic group, women. It is a well known fact that women are not so interested in CPUs, GPUs, RAM and Terabytes (well, not in this targeted group). But we've yet to see a PC ad where there's no technical specification, until now. 



## Ladies Line

It is the Norwegian [web shop and PC-manufacturer PS.no](http://ps.no) that have decided to launch hardware for the ladies. This new line of hardware is called [Ladies Line](http://ps.no/ArtDtl.aspx?i=176378&model=).

Here's an excerpt (directly translated,  you get the idea) from the ad: 

> A PC with a smart brain, and can as most women, multi-task and it's got the memory of an elephant. 

But could this be overkill? Could the targeted consumer group (read: women) be offended by this campaign? [Some women do not respond well](http://www.informationoverlord.co.uk/?p=273) to targeted campaigns. And according to [DinSide.no](http://www.dinside.no/838610/denne-pc-en-har-en-glup-hjerne) they intend to provoke, to get their attention. 
 
I think my wife wouldn't respond well to this campaign, but I think she would liked the PC itself ;)
