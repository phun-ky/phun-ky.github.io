Stumbled upon this PC ad when I browsed <a href="http://ps.no">PS.no</a> for some components, and I think it's worth mentioning. It is a PC specifically made and targeted to one demographic group, women. It is a well known fact that women are not so interested in CPUs, GPUs, RAM and Terabytes (well, not in this targeted group). But we've yet to see a PC ad where there's no technical specification, until now. 


<h2>Ladies Line</h2>
It is the Norwegian <a href="http://ps.no">web shop and PC-manufacturer PS.no</a> that have decided to launch hardware for the ladies. This new line of hardware is called <a href="http://ps.no/ArtDtl.aspx?i=176378&model=">Ladies Line.</a>

Here's an excerpt (directly translated,  you get the idea) from the ad:

 

<blockquote>A PC with a smart brain, and can as most women, multi-task and it's got the memory of an elephant.</blockquote>

 

But could this be overkill? Could the targeted consumer group (read: women) be offended by this campaign? <a href="http://www.informationoverlord.co.uk/?p=273">Some women do not respond well</a> to targeted campaigns. And according to <a href="http://www.dinside.no/838610/denne-pc-en-har-en-glup-hjerne">DinSide.no</a> they intend to provoke, to get their attention. 
 
I think my wife wouldn't respond well to this campaign, but I think she would liked the PC itself ;)

You can definitely say that this PC got a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor">high WAF factor</a> :P
