Yeah, it's a pun, and very intended. Lately (as in the last year) I've been trying to get hold of some new books that's closely related to the things I work with and that will give my skills a more potent edge. I've had some books on my wishlist on amazon.com, and when my boss said ( right out of the blue after a conversation) that the company will pay for it, I pulled out my VISA and ordered the books.
 The shipment is not due until late next month, because I forgot I could order from amazon.co.uk. But it's worth waiting for.
 But I want you to ask yourself this: What do you do to bulletproof your professional creativity? Do you attend courses? Take lectures? Conferences? Read books? Tell me what YOU do to bulletproof your professional creativity!

The books that I ordered are:
