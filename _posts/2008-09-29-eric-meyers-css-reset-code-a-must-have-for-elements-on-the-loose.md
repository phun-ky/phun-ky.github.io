Came over this nifty CSS code to reset all html elements to "default" style. It might help you (or it might not) when you want to start from scratch, i.e. in a CSS file for print.



To quote Eric Meyer, the contributor <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/">of the code</a>: 



<blockquote>The reset styles given here are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for the body element, for example. I don't particularly recommend that you just use this in its unaltered state in your own projects. It should be tweaked, edited, extended, and otherwise tuned to match your specific reset baseline. Fill in your preferred colors for the page, links, and so on.



In other words, this is a starting point, not a self-contained black box of no-touchiness.</blockquote>
