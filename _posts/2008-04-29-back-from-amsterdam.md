There, back from the cruise to Amsterdam! Will get pictures out shortly, when and if I've got the time that is.
 In the mean time, I hope you've tried out ubuntu 8.04, if not, get it <a href="http://phun-ky.net/2008/04/ubuntu-8.04-hardy-heron-LTS-is-out">here</a>.
 Another tip, try to follow the <a href="http://distrowatch.com/news/dwd.xml">distro feed from distrowatch.com</a> to get the latest distro news!
