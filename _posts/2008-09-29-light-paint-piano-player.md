layout: posttitle: "Light-Paint Piano Player"description: ""category: "undefined" tags: [] --- A very cool video made by Ruan Cashman that features a piano player animated with a green laser and long exposure time, pretty sweet.<br /><br/><br /><br/>This is how Ryan Cashman made this masterpiece:<br /><br/><br /><br/><blockquote>Animated light paintings of a little piano player performing. Filmed at night with the lovely I-5 and San Diego skyline in the background. I would like to thank everyone for the fantastic feedback I have received lately. To answer a few questions, I wrote the music and recorded it first. The frames were photographed with a Canon Rebel using 20-30 second exposure time. I used a small green LED keychain light to draw each frame. Once all the positions were photographed they were strung together and synchronized to the music in After Effects.</blockquote><br /><br/><br /><br/>The clip:<br /><br/><br /><br/><object width="400" height="225">  <param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /> <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /> <param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1185346&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /> <embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=1185346&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="225"></embed></object><br /><br/>You can watch the clip in <a href="http://vimeo.com/1185346?pg=embed&sec=1185346&hd=1">HD by going here</a>.
