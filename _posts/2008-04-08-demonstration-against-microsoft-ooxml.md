"Standard Norway defends its<br/>scandalous act by pointing to 37 identical letters that were formulated<br/>by Microsoft and sent to Standard Norway by Microsoft's partners and<br/>customers during the open hearing."</p><br/><br/><p>"If they want numbers, we can give them numbers. Join me on the street<br/>and show your disapproval. Please pass this message on around the globe.<br/>Let's use *our* technology for everything it is worth."</p><br/>
