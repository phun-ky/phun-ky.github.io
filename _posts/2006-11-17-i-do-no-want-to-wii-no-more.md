<p>I just handed in 11 pages of pure marketing management about the release of the latest seventh generation video console from Nintendo. I am so fed up with Wii, even Xbox 360 looks more tempting.. Don't worry, I will get Wii, but not right now. It's not scheduled to release before 8th of December.</p> <p>I will add a link for my norwegian readers to the paper after I get a grade on it. Cross your fingers, I need a D or better to pass this course!</p>
