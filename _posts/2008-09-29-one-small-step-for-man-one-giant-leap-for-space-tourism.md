A big congratulations to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a>a> and his company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a> for the first privately sponsored rocket to reach orbit!

This is another milestone after the human endavour of the space race that started in the 20th century. Now, it's a new space race!

I just can't wait to the day mankind can travel in space!
