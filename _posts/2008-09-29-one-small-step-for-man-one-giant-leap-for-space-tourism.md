A big congratulations to (Elon Musk)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk] and his company (SpaceX)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX] for the first privately sponsored rocket to reach orbit!

This is another milestone after the human endavour of the space race that started in the 20th century. Now, it's a new space race!

I just can't wait to the day mankind can travel in space!
