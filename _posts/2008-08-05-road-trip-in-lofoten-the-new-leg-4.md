<p>After some wavering back and forward about visiting the Alo-festival in Fredvang, we ditched the original plan and drove to Svolvær and met up with Marthe's grandparents on her mother side instead. We spent a night at Sandvika Camping right outside of Svolvær and from there we continued to Ramsund, the place where Marthe grew up.</p> <p>We've been in Ramsund since sunday, and we're continuing back to Hamarøy on thursday.</p>
