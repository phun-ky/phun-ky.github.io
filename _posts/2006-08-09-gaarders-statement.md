layout: posttitle: "gaarders  statement"description: ""category: "undefined" tags: [] --- <p>In relation with the current events in the Middle East, Jostein Gaarder, a norwegian writer, came out <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/article1411153.ece">with a statement </a>  that many had reaction to. He opens fire against the Israeli goverment and rule. He directs critics against the way the slaughter is  managed. Bottom line, he speeks his mind.</p> <p>But still, there are many objections towards his statement. Gaarder has even been threatened for life! Freedom of speech is a good thing, right?</p> <div class="entryImage"><img src="http://cdn.umedia.no/img/jews.jpg" alt="jews against jews" class="reflect"/></div><p>Came across an image that clearly states that it isn't just jewes that supports Israel, it's jews that are against Israel!</p> <p>And to make a point, some John Doe commented Gaarders statement with: <blockquote>"How can it be that criticism of the state of Israel is anti-semitism? When I critize african politics like in Zimbabwe, does that mean that I am a nigger hater?".</blockquote></p>
