Ok, they released it over two weeks ago, but we've very happy with the outcome! <a href="http://www.henne.no">Henne.no</a> now uses the same grid as her sister site, <a href="http://www.kk.no">kk.no</a>. A congrats to the <a href="http://www.henne.no">Henne.no</a> staff is in order!



This redesign was a dramatic improvement of the whole <a href="http://www.henne.no">Henne.no</a> product. The site is now rigged for an imense traffic growth in the furture. For the first time <a href="http://www.henne.no">Henne.no</a> is in harmony with the web usability convention. The readers can now focus on the wide and rich content this site offers.
