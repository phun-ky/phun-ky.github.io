<p>Ok, I know  that I'm not continously searching the Internet for IT news, but this is something I really should've noticed. I noticed today on the <a href="http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/implemented_ideas/8.04/">Ubuntu Brainstorm site, under "Implemented ideas"</a>, that the versjon name "Intrepid Ibex" appeared, I instantly thought "where the hell have I been?". I am usually <a href="http://phun-ky.net/2007/08/hardy-heron-succeeds-gutsy-gibbon">pretty early to know what the next distro from ubuntu is named</a>.</p> <p>Oh well.</p> <p>Btw, after following some links, I got to a <a href="http://whijo.net/blog/brad/2008/02/21/intrepid-ibex.html">blog entry</a> describing the naming issues of the versions :P Pretty funny, check it out.</p>
