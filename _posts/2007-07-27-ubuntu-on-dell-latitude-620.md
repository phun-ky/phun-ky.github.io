<p>Ever since I got the laptop I use at work, I always wondered what it was like to have a GNU/Linux OS on it. I've experimentet with a Compaq Evo N800 and Fedora releases before, but that didn't work like a charm. However, the Dell 620 and the Ubuntu Studio based on Feisty Fawn really worked like a charm!</p> <p>I'm not posing as a preacher of GNU/Linux OS here, but it works mate. The install was much easier than the Windows, but there are some quirks yet to be fixed; The partitioning is not fit for a layman, you know as well as I do that to fiddle with partitioning when you don't have a clue is a no-no.</p> <p>Ok, this is what works out of the box:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Intel 945 Wireless (restriced driver)</li>
<li>Sound, Basic Graphix (max 1024) and Networking</li>
<li>Mute and volume buttons</li>
</ul>
 <p>This did not work out of the box:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Widescreen Support and Resolution (had to spend 3 hours fixing this, and face it, 1024 looks idiotic on a 24 inch wide monitor.)</li>
<li>The Alt Gr key was not working, a real pain in the ass when you program as much as I.</li>
</ul>
 <p>As you can see, this is not really big issues Ubuntu has with out of the box installs. The gap between GNU/Linux and Mac Os/Windows is closing in faster and faster. I believe that after Dell has launched their Ubuntu boxed deliveries to outside of US countries, the gap would soon be gone, forever.</p> <p>As a little note: I still remain to find a program in Windows that does not have an equal or better opposite in GNU/Linux. Do you?</p>
