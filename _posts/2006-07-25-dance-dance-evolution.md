Some amusement in these dark times. No, this is not a post about the crazy dance machine jippo that even a kid or a guy with crutches can win, or the game where you lure your granny to try it and watch her fall down and break a hip or two; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution">dance dance revolution</a>, I hate that stuff. (But I love it when women do it ^^ ). 

Scimmed <a href="http://www.thatvideosite.com">thatvideosite.com</a> and came across this: <a href="http://www.thatvideosite.com/view/2316.html">http://www.thatvideosite.com/view/2316.html</a> the memories flows in on you when you watch it, and you will laugh. 

Kinda reminds you that you really looked stupid when you danced..
