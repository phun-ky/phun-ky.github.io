A brief post this thursday morning, with great news.
 The next Ubuntu distro to succeed Gutsy Gibbon (7.10) is called Hardy Heron (8.04).
 A little excerpt from jonobacon@home:
 "Not only will the Ubuntu community continue to do what it does best, produce an easy-to-use, reliable, free software platform, but this release will proudly wear the badge of Long Term Support (LTS) and be supported with security updates for five years on the server and three years on the desktop. We look forward to releasing the Hardy Heron in April 2008."
 The release is due April 2008, but we will have the release of Gutsy Gibbon in October this year, I can't wait, can you?
