We picked up a new cat today! We've been looking at him for over a month and we finally decided. I named him Linux;) Don't ask why, figure it out for yourself. Linux is only twelve weeks old, so he can't be castraded yet. Hehe, he is free for another 2 months :P
 The other cat that we have, Lucifer, is insulted and does nothing but to sneer at Linux. We hope that it is mearily a short period of time for Lucifer to adjust to the new cat. Wish us luck!
