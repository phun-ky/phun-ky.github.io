New distro from the Czech Republic is out, Slax 6.0.3!
 Slax is a Slackware-based bootable CD containing a Linux operating system, designed with a modular approach.
 Despite its small size, Slax provides a wide collection of pre-installed software for daily use, including a well-organised graphical user interface and useful recovery tools for system administrators.
