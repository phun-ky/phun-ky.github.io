In the last weeks NetCom, the 2nd largest mobile net provider in Norway, have advertised that tomorrow, Monday 22nd of March, they will announce a spectacular new product. They claim that it will be the first of its kind in Norway.
<h2>So what is it?</h2>

A journalist at <a href="http://www.dinside.no/838454/netcom-avslorer-hemmelighet">DinSide</a> mentioned that it could be the launch of Google's Nexus One mobile phone, but that was quickly disregarded when a reader pointed out that the Nexus One is already buyable in Norway.




"Small to bring, completely wireless and easy to share".

<h2>A portable WiFi gadget</h2> 

A reader with some speedy reflexes managed to get some screen shots from the unofficial landing page for the advertisements. 
<a href="http://cdn.phun-ky.net/img/blog/img5a6ce986fce387a9b4ce9eb3a0468c12.png" rel="lightbox[article]" title=""><img class="reflect rheight15" src="http://cdn.phun-ky.net/img/blog/img5a6ce986fce387a9b4ce9eb3a0468c12.png" alt="img5a6ce986fce387a9b4ce9eb3a0468c12.png" title="" /></a>
<a href="http://cdn.phun-ky.net/img/blog/img1312bfa3fc754f57c9a2ffb77772be4b.png" rel="lightbox[article]" title=""><img class="reflect rheight15" src="http://cdn.phun-ky.net/img/blog/img1312bfa3fc754f57c9a2ffb77772be4b.png" alt="img1312bfa3fc754f57c9a2ffb77772be4b.png" title="" /></a>
The landing page claims that the new product is going to be what NetCom call a "miniruter". Directly translated, it's "minirouter", but technically, it's a portable WiFi spot. This means that the user of this gadget can bring along a WiFi spot wherever the user is. Nifty. 




NetCom states. "We thought it would be a tool for bloggers on the move".

<h2>Existings products?</h2>
There is already some existing products, combined, that could give you the same thing, but not in that small size and , not totally wireless. You have several applications for mobile phones that can turn the mobile phone to a portable WiFi as long as it has got a WiFi chip (i.e. HTC). Another mobile net/mobile broadband provider, <a href="http://www.ice.no" rel="nofollow">ICE.net</a>, provides a WiFi router that utilizes the old NMT net, but requires an AC adapter to use it.

<h2>Update!</h2>
It turns out, you can already BUY the "miniruter" (the Huawei device that NetCom use aswell) through <a href="http://www.webbutikken.no/aspx/loginVnet.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2faspx%2fprodukt%2fprdinfovnet.aspx%3fplid%3d11715&plid=11715" rel="nofollow">a norwegian webshop</a>. So NetCom is actually just selling a new subscription plan..
