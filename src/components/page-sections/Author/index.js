    <p class="ph">
      Hi! My name is Alexander, and I am a creative frontender,
      specializing in UX, accessibility, universal design,
      frontend-architecture, node and design systems. I am passionate
      with open source projects and love to dabble with new emerging
      technologies related to frontend. With over 24 years of frontend
      experience, I have earned the right to be called a veteran. I am a
      lover of life, technologist at heart. If I am not coding, I am
      cooking and I love whisky and cigars. Oh, and coffee, I LOVE
      coffee!
