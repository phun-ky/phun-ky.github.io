I am a frontender, not a designer, as you will see..

Thanks to the [WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/), I was able to get a hold of some screenshots for my old versions of this site. Let us go through them and see how much they have evolved, or not. Bear in mind that the [WayBack Machine](https://archive.org/web/) does not save images or all external CSS, so the outcome of the screenshots is not 100%, but you get the gist of it.

Yeah.. I remember this setup. It was back in 2001 when "everything" was made in [Macromedia Dreamwever](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/old-software/html-editors/macromedia-dreamweaver-1-2), and every site had the mandatory "best viewed in …" phrase.. And of course, a catchy tagline, mine was "be free, be fly, be phun-ky". \*cringe\*

And yes, a random quote that I liked. 

The name `phun-ky`, is actually the nick I started to use by the turn of the millenia. Before that I used the `redavr` nick, because i loved [Command & Conquer: Red Alert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer:_Red_Alert) and I used my initials. `phun-ky` was born after a musical love affair that I had with Fatboy Slim, and his mix of [DJ Tonka - Phun-Ky](https://www.discogs.com/release/11632-DJ-Tonka-Phun-Ky). And the rest is history. I have used that nick ever since, on [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), forums, work and gaming.

Oh, and of course, my made up company "United Media". I kinda dreamt of starting my own agency, but it never came to that. But later on, I started "UMedia", a computer hardware company with my brother and a couple of our friends, but that is another story.

Hehe, I remember that I was going to build a community on that site.With reports on games, movies etc, having my own forums, letting buddies of mine write stuff and to be a part of that community. I also hosted some [CounterStrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike_(video_game)) clan pages, including my own clan, "pSc", proud scottsmen clan. \*cringe\*

Big dreams, big dreams..

I started early fidgeting with the code, trying to make it "up to code" with semantics and standards, and during that period I also created some flash stuff. I think I was in conscription (mandatory military service) when I created this version.I still loved the blue-ish color I see.

But it was not until 2004 that I started to blog, but that was more deep personal stuff, not really suited in a public domain, so I scraped this. The design was something I cooked up from a college project I had.  Oh, and you see already there, the link to 508, which was the forerunner for the WCAG standards.

Still some shades of blue.

Aaand in 2006 I switched the color palette, to red. How original. A bit more writing, mostly related to gaming, CS and World of Warcraft. Hm, still doing music and movie reports apparently.

I remember I created the red doodle in MS Paint. \*cringe\*

Still playing WoW, but again, switched colors. Mostly wrote about programming, politics and linux releases apparently. And the tag line that I still use was born. "The world from my point of view, and some pedantic creativity".

Yep, nope. Never doing that again. Skewed boxes with too much shadow? \*facepalm\*

Well, at least I get my headshot up now. And the current title for my blog was made: "lover of life, technologist at heart".

Ah yes, here I decided I just needed a frontpage, with the links to the _very_ few posts I had on medium.com.. 

So, over 20 years of doing frontend and posing as a blog writer has led to the site you are visiting now. Has it improved? I think so. Now hopefully, I can focus on my writing :P
