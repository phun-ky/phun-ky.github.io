Great news from Gentoo Linux! They've released their latest beta, 2008.0 beta 1.

Gentoo Linux is a versatile and fast, completely free Linux distribution geared
towards developers and network professionals. Unlike other distros, Gentoo Linux
has an advanced package management system called Portage. Portage is a true
ports system in the tradition of BSD ports, but is Python-based and sports a
number of advanced features including dependencies, fine-grained package
management, "fake" (OpenBSD-style) installs, safe unmerging, system profiles,
virtual packages, config file management, and much much more.
