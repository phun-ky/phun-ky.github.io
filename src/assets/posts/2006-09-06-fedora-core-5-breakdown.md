If you have been dealing with Linux over the last three or four years, you
should have stumbled across a distro called Fedora. This article is meant to
elaborate the whole concept of Fedora and to give new users a helping hand.

First of all, what is Fedora? Fedora is really a Russian female name, but it is
also the name of the type of hat you see in the Red Hat Linux logo. The link to
Red Hat starts there.

Fedora, or Fedora Core, is a project developed and maintained by the
community-supported Fedora Project and it's sponsored by Red Hat. Fedora aims to
be a complete, general-purpose operating system built from open source software.
Ok, enough with Wikipedia, but let us mention the only things needed to know;

- It's a community-supported project. That means that you can be involved in
  creating Fedora Core, if you want.
- A new version of Fedora Core comes out every six months.
- When a new version comes out, the previous version becomes unsupported after
  another 6 - 8 months.
- And as a little perk, it is completely free. If you want to read more about
