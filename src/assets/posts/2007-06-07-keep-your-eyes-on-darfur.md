The conflict in Sudan has driven to million people into fugitivity. At least
200.000 people are killed in the conflict, but the government in Sudan reject
the genocide accusations.

Amnesty International has now released a site where YOU can monitor and see for
yourself the destrucion and genocide that is happening in Sudan.

## About the project

Amnesty International USA's unprecedented Eyes On Darfur project leverages the
power of high-resolution satellite imagery to provide unimpeachable evidence of
the atrocities being committed in Darfur - enabling action by private citizens,
policy makers and international courts. Eyes On Darfur also breaks new ground in
protecting human rights by allowing people around the world to literally "watch
over" and protect twelve intact, but highly vulnerable, villages using
commercially available satellite imagery.
