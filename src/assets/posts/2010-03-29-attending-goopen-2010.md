on how they've used
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.osgeo.org/">OSGeo</a>,

### A Government's Vision Becomes Reality: OSS Implementation in the Malaysian Public Sector - by Tan King Ing

> Open Source Software is expected to bring financial benefits, as well as
> process improvements, to Government agencies to enable more integrated and
> improved public services for Malaysia, its citizens and enterprises. Malaysia
> is one of the early pioneers to have a Government-wide OSS Master Plan,
> executed concertedly and relentlessly under the leadership and coordination of
> Open Source Competency Centre MAMPU. As an early adopter of OSS, in the last
> six years Malaysia's Public Sector has made significant inroads in changing
> mindsets and beliefs, and proliferating open source projects, products and
> services throughout its agencies and the private sector. This presentation
> shares that journey, exploring the challenges, achievements and lessons learnt
> along the way.

### The Battle Over Source Code - by Ann-Therese Lotherington

> Should the public sector buy proprietary software or seek open source systems
> and what are the best strategies for system development in this sector ? This
> paper considers why an interdisciplinary approach is appropriate for exploring
> these questions?

> Source have grown into a lot of fields. Jan Wildeboer will show what has
> happened, what can be hoped for and what risks we see on our way.
