Are you sure you are secure with your browser choice? Are you still using
archaic and bloated browsers as Internet Explorer? Why
[would anyone use Internet Explorer](http://robertnyman.com/2007/03/23/why-would-anyone-use-internet-explorer/)?
Or do you find yourself stuck with a browser and want to try something new? Try
one of these:

- [Firefox](https://mozilla.com)
- [Opera](https://opera.com)
- [Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome)
- [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/)

## Have you made a decision yet?

If not, you can always head over to Opera to check out their
