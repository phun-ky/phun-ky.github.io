I was so looking forward to try the Safari beta on Windows when Safari beta was
released. The experience from the browser after some first views was not good,
at all. I didn't have the same problems as
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200706/safari_now_officially_available_for_windows/">Roger
Johansson</a> had, my Safari beta won't show me any h1 or span tags! It bugs.
Badly.

Does anyone have the same experience? Noone? I guess someone out there has
problems at least! David Maynor, a contributor to the Errata Security blog is
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://erratasec.blogspot.com/2007/06/niiiice.html">continuously
updating his post with new bugs</a> in Safari.

"The world best browser" indeed.. I did not test the other features, 'cause I
was so hung up on the fact that it could not display tags correctly. At first
glance, I thought that it was my fault with some really bad CSS, but no, I found
the same bug on external sites as well, like:
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.vg.no">vg.no</a>
, the most used news site in Norway.

I took notice that several bloggers that I'm reading did mention some problems
with the browser crashing, I have not experienced that yet with Safari beta. Let
us hope that the RC is better than the beta.
