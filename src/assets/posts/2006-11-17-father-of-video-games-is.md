During the research for my paper, I stumbled over an article that claimed that
the father of the video games was William Higinbotham. The article was published
on a norwegian site for research papers,
[forskning.no](http://www.forskning.no/Artikler/2004/mars/1077822052.02) a view
also supported by an article on
[Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Higinbotham). Quite
amazing the setup he used for the game. But that's not the point, further in my
research I stumbled across [PONG-Story](http://www.pong-story.com/), a site
dedicated to "the inventor of the video game" written by David Winter.

I contaced Winter via mail and asked him for a comment on these articles, read
below.

My email to David Winter:

> Hi! Checked your site for a paper I am writing for my marketing course on my
> university in Norway, and would like a comment on something that I found odd.
> You say that it is Ralph Baer that is the father of the video games, but isn't
> it William Higinbotham that made the world first video game?
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Higinbotham . Looking forward to a comment

His reply was:

> Hi,

> To put the record straight: you will always make the difference between
> digital and analog audio devices although they produce sound. Therefore, you

> This is same with the video game: one made a computer game, and another

> Crediting Higginbotham as having invented the video game is as absurd as

>
> Same with the video game VS computer games.

Any thoughts on this from my readers?
