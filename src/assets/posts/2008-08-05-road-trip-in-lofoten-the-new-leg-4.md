After some wavering back and forward about visiting the Alo-festival in
Fredvang, we ditched the original plan and drove to Svolvær and met up with
Marthe's grandparents on her mother side instead. We spent a night at Sandvika
Camping right outside of Svolvær and from there we continued to Ramsund, the
place where Marthe grew up. We've been in Ramsund since sunday, and we're
continuing back to Hamarøy on thursday.
