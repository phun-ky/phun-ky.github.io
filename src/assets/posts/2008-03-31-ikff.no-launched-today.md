Ikff.no launched today, actually 00:05 last night!

IKFF is the Norwegian equivalent of WILPF, Women's International League for
Peace and Freedom.

The Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) is an
international Non Governmental Organization (NGO) with national sections,
covering all continents with an international secretariat based in Geneva, and a
New York office focused on the work of the United Nations.

Since its establishment in 1915, WILPF has brought together women from around
the world who are united in working for peace by non-violent means, promoting
political, economic and social justice for all.

I did the whole front-end and back-end. The back-end is WordPress and the
front-end is a self made WordPress theme. A bit of advice if you are to make
your own WordPress theme, make sure you have a lot of time on your hands :P
