A brief post this thursday morning, with great news.

The next Ubuntu distro to succeed Gutsy Gibbon (7.10) is called Hardy Heron
(8.04).

A little excerpt from jonobacon@home:

> Not only will the Ubuntu community continue to do what it does best, produce
> an easy-to-use, reliable, free software platform, but this release will
> proudly wear the badge of Long Term Support (LTS) and be supported with
> security updates for five years on the server and three years on the desktop.
> We look forward to releasing the Hardy Heron in April 2008.

The release is due April 2008, but we will have the release of Gutsy Gibbon in
October this year, I can't wait, can you?
