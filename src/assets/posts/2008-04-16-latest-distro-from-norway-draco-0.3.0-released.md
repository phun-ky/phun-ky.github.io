Draco GNU/Linux is a distribution based on Slackware Linux and "pkgsrc", a
package management system developed by NetBSD.

A new version, 0.3, was released a few days ago: "Introducing Draco GNU/Linux
0.3.0. Featuring kernel 2.6.23 (with optional 2.6.16), glibc 2.6.1, GCC 4.1.2,
and OSS 4.0. Selected packages from pkgsrc are available through the repository
and on an ISO image. This release also introduces Draco Desktop. Draco Desktop
contains the latest stable Draco release, bundled with software from the latest
pkgsrc branch. Draco Desktop defaults to Xfce, with Fluxbox as an option."
