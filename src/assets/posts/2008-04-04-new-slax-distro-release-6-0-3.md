New distro from the Czech Republic is out, Slax 6.0.3! Slax is a Slackware-based
bootable CD containing a Linux operating system, designed with a modular
approach. Despite its small size, Slax provides a wide collection of
pre-installed software for daily use, including a well-organised graphical user
interface and useful recovery tools for system administrators.
