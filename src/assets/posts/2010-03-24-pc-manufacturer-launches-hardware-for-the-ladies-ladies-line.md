Stumbled upon this PC ad when I browsed [PS.no](http://ps.no) for some
components, and I think it's worth mentioning. It is a PC specifically made and
targeted to one demographic group, women. It is a well known fact that women are
not so interested in CPUs, GPUs, RAM and Terabytes (well, not in this targeted
group). But we've yet to see a PC ad where there's no technical specification,
until now.

## Ladies Line

It is the Norwegian [web shop and PC-manufacturer PS.no](http://ps.no) that have
decided to launch hardware for the ladies. This new line of hardware is called
[Ladies Line](http://ps.no/ArtDtl.aspx?i=176378&model=).

Here's an excerpt (directly translated, you get the idea) from the ad:

> A PC with a smart brain, and can as most women, multi-task and it's got the
> memory of an elephant.

But could this be overkill? Could the targeted consumer group (read: women) be
offended by this campaign?
[Some women do not respond well](http://www.informationoverlord.co.uk/?p=273) to
targeted campaigns. And according to
[DinSide.no](http://www.dinside.no/838610/denne-pc-en-har-en-glup-hjerne) they
intend to provoke, to get their attention.

I think my wife wouldn't respond well to this campaign, but I think she would
liked the PC itself ;)
