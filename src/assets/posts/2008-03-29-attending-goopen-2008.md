I am attending GoOpen 2008 in Oslo, 8th to 9th of April. Zak Greant from Mozilla
Foundation and Chris DiBona from Google are some of the speakers at this event.

The event is arranged by National Competence Center for Open Source. The annual
OpenOffice conference is combined with GoOpen this year, double the fun!

I am really looking forward to this event, and to hear Chris DiBona speak! Will
try to post something in between the sessions.
