There's been a lot of fuzz lately in Norway about the whole OOXML vote process.
Standard Norge has,
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://phun-ky.net/2008/03/norway-says-yes-to-ooxml-despite-protests">despite
the opposition's majority vote against OOXML</a>, voted yes to OOXML. In
response to this, Håkon Wium Lie, CTO of Opera Software and the rest of the
opposition won't
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blog.abrenna.com/norwegian-ooxml-vote-did-not-tip-ballot/">stop
fighting against the decision</a>. Last week,
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://blog.abrenna.com/formal-protest-against-norways-yes-to-ooxml/">comittee
chairman Steve Pepper sent ISO a formal letter where he protested against the
decision, and asked that Norway's vote be suspended</a>. Standard Norge
dismissed this and claimed that the majority voted yes to OOXML! In response to
this, Håkon Wium Lie and the rest of the opposition wrote a new letter to ISO to
state that Norway voted NO to OOXML. The whole letter:

> Reference is made to a letter from Steve Pepper of March 31st 2008.
>
> Steve Pepper is the chairman of the Norwegian mirror committee to ISO/IEC JTC
> 1/SC 34. Steve has served ISO as a volunteer for 13 years at his own expense.
> In addition to chairing the Norwegian committee, he has acted as Head of
> Delegation at every SC34 plenary since 1995 and as Convenor of the SC34
> working group responsible for ISO 13250 Topic Maps since its formation
> in 1998.
>
> In his letter, he reported how most members of the Norwegian committee are
> against changing Norway's vote on OOXML from No with comments to Yes, and that
> in spite of this, employees of Standard Norway have decided to unilaterally
> change Norway's vote.
>
> We, the undersigned, are members of the Norwegian Committee SN/K185. We write
> to confirm Steve Pepper's description of this matter. The technical arguments
> made against standardizing OOXML based on the BRM results were compelling to a
> solid majority of the committee, representing a wide range of IT competence;
> we find that according to ISO's processes and the processes of Standard
> Norway, these technical arguments should have carried greater weight than the
> arguments brought by OOXML's proponents.
>
> We recognize that ISO already has approved OOXML. Still, we request that ISO
> records the Norwegian vote in accordance with the vast majority and the
> technical arguments of the Norwegian committee:
>
> Norway voted No on OOXML!

> Kind regards,

Now, the next step is for our government to eiter decline OOXML fully, or accept
it fully as an open standard together with ODF.
