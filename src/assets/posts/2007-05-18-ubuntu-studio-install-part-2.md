There are just 2 steps needed to install any Ubuntu version really. Insert
CD/DVD and point/click.

But the fun thing about it was that after I got hold of a DVD to write the ISO
on, the DVD was DVD-R, so to install Ubuntu Studio on my stationary, I had to
rip out my DVD+-R drive from my HTPC.. Took some pix of it, but adding them
later.

After I got it installed, I tried the basic: get the network connection up ASAP.
Just had to plug it in, nothing more. Brutal! After that I tried to install
pidgin (or any other through apt-get), but it turns out that was pretty annoying
due to the fact that the first repository in the list was the DVD, and I removed
that drive right after the install.. I found the solution at
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://monkeyblog.org/ubuntu/installing/#enabling_extra_repositories">monkeyblog</a>
right after I posted for help in another forum. The solution was to disable the
local repositories.

Thats it for now, pix will come later.
