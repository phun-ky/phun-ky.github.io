## Get your statistics on with Clicky!

Do you have a personal or proffesional website and wondered how many visitors
you have? Do you think about what your readers search for to be directed to your
site? Where are your readers coming from? What are the readers doing on your
site? If you have asked yourself any of these questions, and want answers, not
more questions, I'm going to share with you how you can get these answers nicely
bundled up and presented in a very detailed view.

The solution to your statistical needs is Clicky 2.0!

## What is Clicky?

Clicky is a web analyzer that works great with any web site, even Ajax and Flash
sites. It was originally targeted towards smaller web sites and blogs because it
tracks a high level of detail on every visitor, and these types of sites find
this information very interesting.

## Where can get it?

Well, you can go here:
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://getclicky.com/8568">Clicky
Web Statistics</a> to register for the free demo, if you want to read more about
it,
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://getclicky.com/help">go
here</a>.

## Why do I like it?

Well, the interface is very appealing to browse through when I check out the
statistics and it's very easy to implement on the site. With the statistic input
you gain more knowledge about your readers on what they searched for, what link
that directet them here and even how long the visit was. Many nice-to-have
functions wrapped around a slick interface.
