In these days, we hear about the phenomena "web 2.0" more and more often. To
make it short, web 2.0 is a phrase made to describe second generation network
generic services on the Internet. It is not like some might think it is, a
second version of the Internet. And the subject for this post is, you've guessed
it, a web 2.0 service.

Searched the forums of
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.diskusjon.no">Diskusjon.no</a>
, the forum for the largest norwegian hardware community,
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.hardware.no">Hardware.no</a>
, and stumbled over a link to something called
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://desktoptwo.com/">Desktoptwo</a>
<br/>. I clicked the link mentioned and there I was.
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://desktoptwo.com/">Desktoptwo</a>
<br/> offers a online desktop with over 1GB of disk space.

It includes everything a normal desktop has, background image, icons, IM
services, desktop look-a-like mail interface and much more. I am not advertising
about it, but if you are interested in new web services, try it ;)
