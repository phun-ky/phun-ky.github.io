Frameport was created with the goal of simplifying the display of responsive
components in style guides and documentation. It empowers you to create iframes
with your component's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them act as natural
viewports. It's a zero-dependency package, making it easy to integrate into your
projects.

With frameport, you can create any viewport you want on a web page. This can be
useful for a variety of purposes, such as:

- Showcasing the different responsive modes of your components
- Sandbox content

Frameport is incredibly easy to use. Simply add the add the required attributes
or use the import with options, and frameport will do the rest. You can also
wrap the viewports with the style of your choosing.
