  "This talk will demonstrate the pains a developer have with the designer when
  the developer implements typography design. Ever wondered why the distance
  between a title and the text says 30px in the sketch, but it won't line up
  with your html and css? Well, this talk will make you understand why, and how
  to fix this :)"
