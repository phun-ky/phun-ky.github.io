Well, I took a sneak at the daily comic strip of M, authored and drawn by Mads
Eriksen, and I didn't quite get it, so I googled and came across a YouTub clip
containing the explanation in form of a old Muppet Show sequence.

Have a look at the comic,then check out the clip:

The norwegian in the last frame is translated into: "...of ALL the lousy
atte..", got it?

The link to the comic strip is
