Speccer was originally created to make it easier to document components in a
design system, but you can use it for whatever you like, whenever you need to
highlight any element in your web projects.

With speccer, you can highlight any element on a web page or in documentation
with pins, markers, arrows, and more. This can be useful for a variety of
purposes, such as:

- Showcasing the different parts of a component or design system
- Documenting how to use a particular element or feature
- Drawing attention to important information
- Creating interactive tutorials or demos
