2 weeks ago we signed off
[seher.no](http://www.seher.no)
. We've exported the site from Polopoly(Java Server Pages) to our own CMS and
servers (LAMP).

Seher.no reaches 140 000 unique visitors.

For those unfamiliar with seher.no , it's the web part of Se og HÃ¸r, a
gossip-celeb magazine.

I did template work for the pages, and made a drag and drop interface to edit
the main page positions ;)
