Public letter from Benjamin Henrion:

> Dear signatory of the **NO** OOXML petition.
> 
> Steve Pepper, the former Chairman of the Norwegian committee responsible
> for deciding the Norwegian vote on OOXML, is calling for a demonstration
> to take place outside the building where SC34, the ISO committee that
> has been landed with OOXML, is holding its spring plenary.
> 
> The demonstration will take place outside HÃ¥ndverkeren, Rosenkrantzgate
> 7, Oslo, Norway, on Wednesday April 9 at 12.00.
> 
> Among the slogans are:
> 
> * No to ISO approval of OOXML!
> * Defend the integrity of ISO!
> * Microsoft: Support ODF!
> * Ecma: Withdraw OOXML
> * Norway must say no to OOXML!
> 
> 
> Steve Pepper is supported by the majority of the Norwegian technical
> committee who were against approving OOXML, but who were overruled by
> the bureaucracy at Standard Norway.
> 
> "I call on all those opposed to ISO's approval of OOXML to join this
> demonstration", says Steve Pepper. "Standard Norway defends its
> scandalous act by pointing to 37 identical letters that were formulated
> by Microsoft and sent to Standard Norway by Microsoft's partners and
> customers during the open hearing."
> 
> "If they want numbers, we can give them numbers. Join me on the street
> and show your disapproval. Please pass this message on around the globe.
> Let's use _our_ technology for everything it is worth."
