I have not been as active as I was before in the
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere">blogosphere</a>
the last year, I've been
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://phun-ky.net/2010/03/back-in-business">rather
busy you might say</a>. But things have changed and I swiped over my bookmarks
of grade A blogs and stumpled upon an article over at
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://orderedlist.com">orderedlist.com</a>,
"<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://orderedlist.com/our-writing/blog/articles/stop-blogging/">Stop
Blogging</a>" by Steve Smith. The article was not mind-blowing, but I felt
frustrated, due to the articles statement about stale/old content, especially
when it comes to technology. I had to leave a comment, and here it is:

## The comment

Well, users that can't seem to figure out how old/stale/archaic/not fresh and so
on the content of a web log post/article/how-to should really be paying the
price themselves.

And if we (the bloggers) are going to apprehend these ideas of protecting the
public from stale content, where is the border? Who decides what is stale
content or not? You? W3? The government? The man? And if they decide, when?
After 1 week? Month? Year? Decade?

And furthermore, when "when" is decided upon by anyone, how should this be
displayed to the user/reader/customer/spider ?

To quote Sir Tim Berners-Lee:
