New distro from DistroWatch.com, SystemRescueCD!

SystemRescueCd is a Linux system on a bootable CD-ROM for repairing your system
and your data after a crash. It also aims to provide an easy way to carry out
admin tasks on your computer, such as creating and editing the partitions of the
hard disk. It contains many of system utilities (parted, partimage, fstools,
...) and basic ones (editors, Midnight Commander, network tools).

It aims to be very easy to use: just boot from the CD-ROM, and you can do
everything. The kernel of the system supports most important file systems
(ext2/ext3, ReiserFS, XFS, JFS, VFAT, NTFS, ISO9660), and network ones (Samba
and NFS). SystemRescueCd is based on the Gentoo Live CD.
