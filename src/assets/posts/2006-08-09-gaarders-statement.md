In relation with the current events in the Middle East, Jostein Gaarder, a
norwegian writer, came out
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.aftenposten.no/meninger/kronikker/article1411153.ece">with
a statement </a> that many had reaction to. He opens fire against the Israeli
goverment and rule. He directs critics against the way the slaughter is managed.
Bottom line, he speeks his mind.

But still, there are many objections towards his statement. Gaarder has even
been threatened for life! Freedom of speech is a good thing, right?

Came across an image that clearly states that it isn't just jewes that supports
Israel, it's jews that are against Israel!

And to make a point, some John Doe commented Gaarders statement with:

> "How can it be that criticism of the state of Israel is anti-semitism? When I
> critize african politics like in Zimbabwe, does that mean that I am a nigger
> hater?".
