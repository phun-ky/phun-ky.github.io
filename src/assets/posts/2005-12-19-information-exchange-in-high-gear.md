## Introduction

While the internet is often described as a global phenomenon, it's crucial not
to overlook personal information systems, family, and group information systems
as integral parts of it.

This article is based on a piece by Berners-Lee, addressing two scenarios. The
first concerns the internet becoming too monocultural, and the second deals with
the opposite—becoming too multicultural. The article doesn't provide a
definitive conclusion but focuses on the process leading to both scenarios.

Human beings have always had the need to communicate. Native Americans used
smoke signals, settlers sent letters via the Pony Express, and Alexander Graham
Bell invented the telephone (Lauckner, Litner, 2003). Until today, various
communication methods have been invented, such as mobile phones, pagers,
satellites, and the internet, among others, with many still in use.

Like all communication mediums, the internet has its own impact on the culture
of its users (Eriksen, 2005). It is perhaps the communication medium that is
still most under development. New websites emerge, better connectivity options
are offered to private and public consumers, and various entities introduce new
concepts for internet use (Valmot, 2004).

Information technology has proven unpredictable in recent years. Initially hyped
as a "tsunami that would sweep over us," the internet today is better described
as a small stream growing into a large river (Eriksen, 2005).

### Materials and Methods

A qualitative method was employed to gather data on internet development.
Literature searches were conducted using major search engines such as
Google/Kvasir, as well as news websites' search engines and the ACM database.
The theoretical compendium (2005) provided by NITH Oslo for PJ400 students was
also utilized.

## How Will the Internet Develop in the Future?

### Discussion

The internet has not led to enormous economic growth or turned the world into a
"global village" as previously predicted. Technology does not behave uniformly
everywhere, but it has elicited diverse reactions globally. Many schools in
Scandinavia assume that students have internet access at home, even though
internet usage is still in its infancy (Eriksen, 2005).

Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (2002) addresses what the internet is, how it is
structured, and how it came into being in his article. Towards the end, he
presents two possible development scenarios for the internet, the two major
concerns he describes:

Berners-Lee (2002), Director of W3C, says:

> The internet will become like a huge McDonald's, and internationally, just
> like a monoculture. When the transatlantic internet cable was to be laid, the
> French feared that the Louvre culture would be trampled by Disney culture.
>
> <footer class="ph">
>
> – (Berners-Lee, 2002, p. 8, my translation)
>
> </footer>

By this, Berners-Lee means that there will be a portal superior to all others.
This portal becomes the only medium through which everyone perceives the world.
This scenario leads to homogenization of society. Berners-Lee further states
that it would be terrible if the language were to become so simple that everyone
could understand it. The problem with monoculture would then be the content, as
it would become too uniform.

He also addresses another scenario for the future development of the internet;
it will become too multicultural. There will be several small communities with
their own norms, cohesiveness, and understanding of communication. The author
believes this can lead to significant problems when individuals from one
community communicate with outsiders. Violence can often become the only method
of communication (Berners-Lee, 2002). Communication becomes the challenge in the
multicultural alternative, not only in everyday interactions as mentioned
earlier but also between people on the internet. Language problems will arise
when others have their understanding of their language, especially when
character sets do not work well together. The first HTML documents could only
represent Western European languages (not Asian languages), but in HTML 5.0
released in 2000, also known as XHTML, Unicode was supported. Only then could
the character sets of the entire world be used in a standard manner
(wikipedia.org, 2005).

In an article written by Thomas Hylland Eriksen, a professor at the Department
of Social Anthropology at Blindern, a concern closely related to what
Berners-Lee describes is raised.

> "Pessimists of various kinds have argued that the internet would destroy
> thinking because information becomes so fragmented, that it would degenerate
> into a marketplace, that it would be a tool for total North American cultural
> dominance in the world, that it would weaken local communities and create
> anonymity and alienation." (Eriksen, 2005, "Unintended Consequences" (page
> numbers not provided))

> "But this is not a concern supported by existing research on the internet
> today," says Eriksen. About half of the content on the internet is in
> languages other than English. Eriksen further suggests that it is not a bad
> idea for the world to be bilingual.

As mentioned above, local communities can be either strengthened or weakened by
being mediated via the internet. Some such communities, geographically
fragmented, would hardly exist without a technology like the internet. A study
from Trinidad shows that Trinidadians use the internet to strengthen their
cultural identity, and it positively impacts traditional family values to
maintain daily contact across oceans (Eriksen, 2005, "Unintended Consequences"
(page numbers not provided)).

The internet has a significant impact on work, leisure, knowledge, and
worldview. Take Wikipedia as an example; Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia
written and updated by volunteers around the clock worldwide (wikipedia.org,
2005). What makes Wikipedia special is that anyone, at any time, can edit any
article.

Here, information is asserted by ordinary people, not just professors, experts,
and researchers. This is a medium where everyone can be informed about what they
want, but users face a choice. The choice lies in trusting information that is
not confirmed by higher academic institutions. Wikipedia is an information
channel that influences our knowledge, whether the information is false or
accurate. It was recently pointed out that one of the creators of Wikipedia,
Jimmy Wales, believes that much of the information there is nonsense:

> "Wales, in response to a statement by a former colleague, admitted that much
> of the information on Wikipedia is not adequately safeguarded against errors.
> In some cases, the content has been nonsense."

Today, there are many different user groups on the internet: users who want to
run applications and interact over the internet, commercial internet service
providers selling internet services for profit, private-sector internet
providers operating part of the internet, governments upholding laws, protecting
consumers, and so on. Owners of internet patents and providers of public
services also fall under these user groups (Clark, Wroclawski, Sollins, Braden,
2002).

Within these mentioned categories, there are also various types of users: people
who send spam to make money, music lovers who want to share their recordings,
copyright holders who want to stop them, people who want to talk to each other
privately, while authorities want to eavesdrop on conversations. With so many
user groups within this field growing larger every day, the development of the
internet will increase in line with technological advancements. This is
considering new services being launched and new connectivity options (lyse.no,
2001).

## Can the Increasing Flow of Information Be Managed?

The flow of information reaches new heights every day
(internettrafficreport.com, 2005); cable networks must be expanded, and at
certain times, the internet becomes overloaded (Doctorow, 2005). In 1997, French
Telecom had to build a new cable network that increased capacity fivefold to
keep up with internet development (itavisen.no, 1997).

In 2004, over 60% of Norwegian households were connected to the internet
(ssb.no, 2003), and today, 695,000 private households in Norway have high-speed
internet connectivity (itavisen.no, 2005). Two years ago, there were over 605
million computers connected to the internet (infoplease.com, 2002); in 1999, the
number was 162 million (Oliver, 1999). This shows an exceptionally rapid growth
of computers with access to the internet. With this growth of connected
machines, all IPv4 addresses will soon be exhausted (tunnelbroker.as8758.net,
2005). That is to say, there will soon be "no room" for more machines on the
internet. IPv4 offers less than one address per person living on this planet,
hence the need for a new version with a larger address space. The solution is
IPv6. In addition to providing a larger address space, IPv6 offers a new and
better-designed protocol stack that includes everything IPv4 has. IPv6 is
backward compatible and is currently being implemented on the internet slowly
but surely.

With the increasing flow of information, the composition of users, intra-group
information exchange, global terrorist activities, and job redundancy, several
authoritarian bodies have become aware that the internet is an information
source that must be monitored (cnn.com, 2005). There is not much time between
articles in some of Norway's largest newspapers discussing that employers read
their employees' private emails (aftenposten.no, 2005). Internet surveillance is
a widely discussed topic, especially as it can affect individual rights. Paul
Bresson, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, says:

> progress does not come at the expense of our nation's safety and security."

## Conclusion

The internet is the largest medium today, and it is continuously growing. In the
early 1990s, the internet was opened for public use, and today, web surfing and
email are part of our daily lives.

While the internet is often described as a global phenomenon, it's crucial not
to overlook personal information systems, family, and group information systems
as integral parts of this. We know that global harmony is necessary for world
peace, but it can only happen when social groups of all sizes are respected
(Berners-Lee, 2002). This also applies via the internet. Berners-Lee believes
that there should be no limits preventing a blog author from linking to public
documents. This would clearly create a limitation in terms of freedom of
expression and the rights of the individual.

A balance must exist going forward, between small and large cultures.
Berners-Lee chooses to describe the connection with the difference in cultures
as a coastline. The closer one gets to a coastline, the more interesting the
structure appears. When one gets closer, more details become noticeable, such as
small stones, seaweed growing on rocks, and so on. The coastline has structure
at all levels.

Can the scenarios described by Berners-Lee become a reality? This is where my
opinion on how the internet will develop lies. Personally, I believe that we
also need a complicated structure; we need a balance. At the same time, one must
be able to consider the individual. Berners-Lee raises two central concerns that
I think everyone in the IT environment should keep in mind regarding
development. It cannot be the case that there is either a monoculture or a
multiculturalism. There must be a balance here. The direction itself should lie
between the two scenarios described by Berners-Lee.

Regarding the flow of information, I am very unsure whether one can be prepared
enough for the increasing information exchange on the internet. It's like
waiting for a tsunami. By tsunami, I don't mean what the internet was hyped up
to be, but how the flow of information can affect us if we are not prepared for
it. If there are no systems and protocols with enough capacity to handle
information, the internet will develop into an unstable network of fragmented
data.

Surveillance is a separate chapter where legal authorities and governments
discuss the topic extensively. I believe that one should be able to say what one
wants without risking reprisals from either authorities or employers. The limit
is when information that can be dangerous, both for nations and ethnic groups,
ends up in the wrong hands.
