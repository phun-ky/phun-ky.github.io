**Background**

&lt;Insert background for the issue here&gt;

**User story**

As a developer on the project, I want to refactor the relevant code to enhance
readability and maintainability. This will allow us to better adhere to coding
standards, improve code organization, and make future updates and maintenance
tasks more efficient.

**Proposed solution**

1. **Separate out code for better readability**: Identify sections of code with
   complex logic or multiple responsibilities and refactor them into smaller,
   more manageable pieces. This can involve extracting functions, creating
   separate modules, or splitting components.
2. **Renaming of variables and functions/methods**: Review variable and
   function/method names to ensure they accurately reflect their purpose and
   improve understanding for other developers. Rename entities where necessary
   to align with naming conventions and make the code base more consistent.
3. **Adhere to a desired length of the file**: Analyze file lengths and refactor
   files that are excessively long to adhere to a desired length, improving code
   organization and readability. This may involve splitting files into smaller
   modules or components.
4. **Move code to the correct context**: Review the current placement of code
   and ensure it is logically grouped in the correct context. Move code to more
   appropriate locations within the code base to improve organization and
   maintainability.
5. **Rewrite function/method/components to optimize both code and readability**:
   Identify functions, methods, or components that are overly complex or
   inefficient and rewrite them to optimize both code performance and
   readability. This may involve simplifying logic, eliminating redundancy, or
   improving algorithm efficiency.
6. **Removal of dead code**: Identify and remove any dead or unreachable code,
   including unused variables, functions, or components. This helps to
   streamline the code base, reduce clutter, and improve overall code
   maintainability.
7. **Eliminate unnecessary dependencies**: Review the existing dependencies and
   identify any that can be replaced with native alternatives provided by the
   language or framework being used. By leveraging native functionality, we can
   reduce external dependencies, simplify the code base, and potentially improve
   performance and compatibility.
8. **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly review and update dependencies to
   ensure that the project is using the latest stable versions. This involves
   monitoring changelogs, security advisories, and compatibility issues, and
   upgrading dependencies as needed to take advantage of new features, bug
   fixes, and security patches.

**Acceptance criteria**

1. The relevant code undergoes a comprehensive review to identify areas for
   refactoring based on the proposed solutions.
2. Refactored code follows established coding standards and naming conventions.
3. Refactored code is logically organized and easy to understand for other
   developers.
4. Refactored code demonstrates improved readability, maintainability, and
   adherence to best practices.
5. The length of files adheres to the desired standard, with any excessively
   long files being appropriately refactored.
6. Refactored code is successfully integrated into the existing code base
   without introducing regressions or breaking existing functionality.
7. Developers involved in the refactoring process provide feedback on the
   effectiveness of the changes and suggest further improvements if necessary.
8. Dead code is identified and removed from the code base, reducing clutter and
   improving code maintainability.
9. Unnecessary dependencies are identified and replaced with native alternatives
   where applicable, reducing external dependencies and simplifying the code
   base.
10. Dependencies are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that the project
    is using the latest stable versions, incorporating new features, bug fixes,
    and security patches.

This issue aims to address the identified areas for refactoring in order to
enhance the overall quality and maintainability of the code base.
