Got a link through facebook regarding one of my favourite things in this world,
whisky! [The Whisky Magazine](http://www.whiskymag.com) wrote in february that
the World Whiskies Awards has finished and the winners was announced. I noticed
some very good bottles in this list, and I know I've tasted some of them at Oslo
Whisky Festival.

## Made in Japan

In this years awards, we see that among the best blended malt whiskies, the
japanese whiskies have three of four awards. I've only tasted one japanese
whisky in my life, but I think I've to sample a bit more from the east.

## The Awards

Seven whiskies have scooped the titles of World's Best' in the final round of
Whisky Magazine's World Whiskies Awards 2010.

The competition, open to proprietary bottlings only, is chaired by Dave Broom,
international whisky expert and exists to inform and educate consumers
throughout the world about the very whisky. Winners progressed through three
rounds of blind tastings to emerge as the victors in their categories, with the
World's Best New Release being chosen from the magazine's tastings section and
tasted during the final round.

Categories are based upon the commonly held whisky groupings which define the
style and process of whisky/whiskey production; malt whisky, blended whisky,
blended malt whisky, American whiskey and whisky liqueurs.

The final "World's Best" trophy winners were presented at the World Whiskies
Awards presentation in London on Thursday 25th February 2010.
