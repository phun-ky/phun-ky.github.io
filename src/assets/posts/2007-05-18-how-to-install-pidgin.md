Very short post here, but I got hold of a very useful tutorial that helped me
pretty much when I tried to install Pidgin.

The Romanian blogger Marilen Corciovei writes a little howto on it:

A quick "what is Pidgin": "Pidgin is a multi-protocol Instant Messaging client
that allows you to use all of your IM accounts at once."
