During these last weeks, the intensity and the drama around the happenings in
the Middle East has almost risen to the point of no return.

The world cannot be bystanders and just watch the situation go out of control,
more than it already has. Personally, I dont think the leaders of the world
really understand the seriousness in this matter.

Let us hope that Rice will make haste and do something during her visit to
Beirut.
