We have not neglected that Fidel Castro is getting older, but we've to go some
decades back to see some real controversity from Cuba. Still, the USA consider
him as a dictator and they have to treat him as one. I am counting the days
before the first wave of the "liberating forces of USA" arrives in Cuba..

But! This is not why I am mentioning Fidel Castro in this post! As I said,
Castro (Fidel) is getting older and he had recently given his little brother,
Raul,
[the power temporarily](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-08-01T032602Z_01_N31365302_RTRUKOC_0_US-CUBA-CASTRO.xml)
due to his forthcoming surgery. Some may say that this was the beginning of the
end of the communistic reign in Cuba, as we read in our dailys:
["Exiles celebrate in Miami over Castro's news"](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=domesticNews&storyID=2006-08-01T051933Z_01_N31345162_RTRUKOC_0_US-CUBA-CASTRO-MIAMI.xml).
But if we draw paralell lines with Castro (Fidel) and any high executive in a
normal corporation, the word temporarily means temporarily.

There's been many
[rumours about Castro's health](http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&storyid=2006-08-01T024715Z_01_N31367531_RTRUKOT_0_TEXT0.xml),
some rumours may be real, but many seems fake. What is your opinions on the
whole Cuba matter?
