I just HAD to post this comic I found. It's a crossover with the suddenly change
in Bush's political course after the recent events in the U.S. and the
continuous Iraqi war. I am a BIG Monty Python fan, and I literally laughed my
ass off the chair when I saw it.

The comic refers to the scene from Monty Pyton and the Quest for the Holy Grail
where King Arthur comes back to the Knights who say Ni only to find out that
they are no longer known as the Knights who say Ni. If you haven't seen it yet,
go see it today!

The comic is from

and the author is Chip Bok! I recommend my readers to read some of his nicely
sketched comics, and I am waiting for him to link a political event to the fish
slapping dance!
