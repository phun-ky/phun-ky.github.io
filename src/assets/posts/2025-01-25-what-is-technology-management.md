To me, _technology management_ is about balancing human and technological
resources to achieve the organization's goals.

It involves leading technologists and development processes in a way that not
only ensures progress but also fosters a learning culture where _knowledge_ is
continuously shared and developed.

The main focus of technology management, as I see it, is facilitation:

1. **Facilitating the acquisition of competence**: Ensuring that employees have
   access to the right knowledge and tools, whether through training, coaching,
   or by creating an environment where learning happens naturally.
2. **Facilitating the sharing of competence**: Building structures and a culture
   for knowledge sharing, where experiences and insights flow between team
   members and departments.
