_Errhh.. "The World Wide Web was created in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee.." I was
off by 2 years according to Wikipedia. _

The
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_wide_web">World
Wide Web</a> is celebrating its 15th birthday this year so I made this little
post just to say: Congratulations! A little anecdote from Douglas Adams:
