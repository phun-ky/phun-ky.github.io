A new distro that could soothe the pain every helpdesk has ever had when it
comes to loss of data!

Recovery Is Possible (RIP) is a Slackware-based CD or floppy
boot/rescue/backup/maintenance system. It has support for a lot of filesystem
types (Reiserfs, Reiser4, ext2/3, iso9660, UDF, XFS, JFS, UFS, HPFS, HFS, MINIX,
MS DOS, NTFS, and VFAT) and contains a bunch of utilities for system recovery.
It also has IDE/SCSI/SATA, PCMCIA, RAID, LVM2, and Ethernet/DSL/cable/PPP/PPPOE
network support.
