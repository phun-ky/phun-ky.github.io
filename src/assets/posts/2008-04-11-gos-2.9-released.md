I stumbled upon a very interesting new linux distro when I checked
[DistroWatch](http://www.distrowatch.com)
this morning, a new distro called gOS (Good OS), with integration of
[Google](http://www.google.com)
products and
[MySpace](http://www.myspace.com)
apps.

gOS is an easy-to-use,
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com)-based
distribution designed for less technical computer users. Its main features are
the use of
<span class="strike">[Enlightenment](http://www.enlightenment.org/)</span>
Gnome as the default desktop and tight integration of various Google products
and services into the product.

Download it
