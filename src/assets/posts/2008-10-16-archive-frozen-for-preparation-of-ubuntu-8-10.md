Steve Langasek reporting:

<blockquote>
 <span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>
  We are one week out from the 8.10 release candidate and two weeks from the final release, so the archive is now frozen and will not thaw again before release.

During the freeze, all uploads to main must be approved by a member of the
release team, so if you have fixes that are important to get in and will need
discussion, please do get in touch as soon as possible. Uploads to main should
at this point focus on release-critical bugs only.

One week left then. I can't wait, can you?
