Ok, I know that I'm not continously searching the Internet for IT news, but this
is something I really should've noticed. I noticed today on the
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/implemented_ideas/8.04/">Ubuntu
Brainstorm site, under "Implemented ideas"</a>, that the versjon name "Intrepid
Ibex" appeared, I instantly thought "where the hell have I been?". I am usually
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/2007/08/30/hardy-heron-succeeds-gutsy-gibbon">pretty
early to know what the next distro from ubuntu is named</a>. Oh well. Btw, after
following some links, I got to a
<a class="ph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://whijo.net/blog/brad/2008/02/21/intrepid-ibex.html">blog
entry</a> describing the naming issues of the versions :P Pretty funny, check it
