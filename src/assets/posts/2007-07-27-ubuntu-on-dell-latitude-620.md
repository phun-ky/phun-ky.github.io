Ever since I got the laptop I use at work, I always wondered what it was like to
have a GNU/Linux OS on it. I've experimentet with a Compaq Evo N800 and Fedora
releases before, but that didn't work like a charm. However, the Dell 620 and
the Ubuntu Studio based on Feisty Fawn really worked like a charm!

I'm not posing as a preacher of GNU/Linux OS here, but it works mate. The
install was much easier than the Windows, but there are some quirks yet to be
fixed; The partitioning is not fit for a layman, you know as well as I do that
to fiddle with partitioning when you don't have a clue is a no-no.

Ok, this is what works out of the box:

- Intel 945 Wireless (restriced driver)
- Sound, Basic Graphix (max 1024) and Networking
- Mute and volume buttons

This did not work out of the box:

- Widescreen Support and Resolution (had to spend 3 hours fixing this, and face
  it, 1024 looks idiotic on a 24 inch wide monitor.)
- The Alt Gr key was not working, a real pain in the ass when you program as
  much as I.

As you can see, this is not really big issues Ubuntu has with out of the box
installs. The gap between GNU/Linux and Mac Os/Windows is closing in faster and
faster. I believe that after Dell has launched their Ubuntu boxed deliveries to
outside of US countries, the gap would soon be gone, forever.

As a little note: I still remain to find a program in Windows that does not have
an equal or better opposite in GNU/Linux. Do you?
