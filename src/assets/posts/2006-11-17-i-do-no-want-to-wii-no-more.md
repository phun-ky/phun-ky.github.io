I just handed in 11 pages of pure marketing management about the release of the
latest seventh generation video console from Nintendo. I am so fed up with Wii,
even Xbox 360 looks more tempting.. Don't worry, I will get Wii, but not right
now. It's not scheduled to release before 8th of December.

I will add a link for my norwegian readers to the paper after I get a grade on
it. Cross your fingers, I need a D or better to pass this course!
